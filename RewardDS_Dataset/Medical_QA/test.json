However, before the operation is done, a clinical and para clinical appraisal is usually done, to determine whether the tumor has already attained other structures or not. This usually helps your surgeon to decide on the appropriate treatment option after surgery, and the speed of installation of this treatment. I believe your surgeon must have done this before surgery, and the speed and invasiveness, type of treatment to be taken are usually based on these findings. However, I would advise you to get to take your chemotherapy as soon as possible, for testicular tumors at times spread very fast, and during the spread period, are clinically silent with no signs and symptoms, revealing themselves only in an advanced stage.

Tortuosity of the blood vessel refers to mild abnormal dilatation of the blood vessel, however, it is not similar to an aneurysm. An aneurysm is an abnormal out-pouching of the artery (a ballot like dilatation).  An aneurysm has a higher risk of rupture and causing brain hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain). Tortuous vessel may predispose to a stroke, as blood flow may be sluggish through a tortuous vessel leading to thrombosis (clot formation). However, this risk is very small.

Is there a chance that Im experiencing pregnancy?", "output": "Hallow Dear, I can feel your frustration from your query. There are various ways to detect pregnancy. The cardinal symptoms of early pregnancy are:1. Missing period2. Frequency of urination3. Nausea & vomiting with aversion to the food.4. Breast changes which include engorgement with tenderness, dark discoloration of nipples & areola with increase in areolar size, small tubercles under the areola (Montgomery's tubercles) and secretions from the nipples. It takes about 10-15 days after missed period for the last 3 symptoms to appear. By that time even clinical examination by a Gynecologist is also quite diagnostic. So just see whether you fit into this picture. However, early pregnancy is never diagnosed only on symptoms and need some confirmatory evidence. After 8-10 days, urine pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample is quite a reliable test. Earlier, these tests may be false negative. By this time, even ultrasonography also can give you direct visual evidence of the pregnancy. Beta Chat Doctor test is very specific and highly sensitive test and can give you the results about pregnancy even few days before missing a period. I feel instead of being stressed in just guess works, it is better you choose one of the above-mentioned options to confirm the diagnosis of pregnancy. "}

I have read your question with care and understand your concerns about the brain swelling. Let me try to help you I understand that your wife continues to have a lot of swelling after the last surgery which was done in 15 April 2014After a stroke, the brain swells and this increases the pressure inside the skull. This increased pressure decreases the blood circulation. So we have to reduce the pressure immediately. For this the surgeon take a part of the skull so that the brain is able to swell freely. Once the swelling of the brain reduces, the part of the skull can be replaced. Or instead of the part of skull, a titanium mesh can be kept Now How long it takes for the swollen brain to Come back to normal size ? It varies from individual to individual For Some, it returns within 2 months. For some, it may take more than 2 years. Now comes the next question Can you give some medicines to decrease the swelling ? Yes, We can Give Medicines Then, why are doctors not giving them, but waiting for 2 years. Because, reducing the swelling by medicine is not going to help us to put the skull back. Only if it reduces naturally, the healing will be good after the second surgery Hope you found the answer helpful. If you need any clarification / have doubts / have additional questions / have follow-up questions, then please do not hesitate in asking again. I will be happy to answer your questions.

From the date of me being told I had grade 3 colon cancer (during an operation to remove my painful appendix) to the date of the latest MRI, six months later, my doctor read the MRI report to me.

Suffering cancer entails deep emotions and getting through ones the darkest hour is not easy.  The problem with most cases is that the first sign of being afflicted with cancer takes place too late when tumors have already formed with damage.  Early detection is a key element and keeping ones immense system strong by a healthy vegetarian diet, lots of fruit and veggies, etc. and reducing stress, goes a long way to retaining ones health.

Your age is also very young for cardiac diseases, so cardiac cause is less likely for your acute sharp chest pain. In my opinion it is muscular pain only, because of sudden muscle pull. And sudden relief from pain is also favouring muscular cause more. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid strenuous exercise.2. Avoid heavyweight lifting.3. Avoid movements causing pain.4. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant.5. Apply warm water pad on affected site if appears again."}

Thank you for the query. According to your description, you probably suffer from heart arrhythmia. This is a condition when heart spontaneously beats irregularly.

This is what you find a lack of pulse for a while. Such condition in most cases is harmless however it should be diagnosed, and it is necessary to find what kind of arrhythmia it is. Moreover, pregnancy is very often associated with heart arrhythmia, and so is anxiety. So we can find pregnancy, anxiety, and ions shortage (especially magnesium and calcium) as an often reasons of such condition. Short ECG can not find it, you should have Holders 24 hours ECG, it should tell if and what type of arrhythmia you suffer from. To ease your symptoms it is advisable to have magnesium supplementation and visit psychiatrist if you can not deal with your anxiety. Hope this will helpRegards"}

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastronomic reflux. It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the baby takes milk, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastronomic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. MOST IMPORTANTLY - 1. DO NOT STOP Breastfeeding.2. DO NOT USE MEDICATIONS LIKE PROBIOTICS FOR THIS. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

That will clear the picture that whether your symptoms are related to diabetes or thyroid disorders. Well, your palpitations demands urgent advice from cardiologist as he might start any medications related to palpitations. In my opinion you can start 0.25 mg of alprazolam to reduce your anxiety as this will in turn reduce your palpitations and sweating too. So far as your sticky sweats are concerned, it is quite common in diabetics. You can use any good quality Persians for it. God bless"}

Pain occasionally wraps around my right ribs and around incisions. Pain in upper back is terrible. Doctors are not listening since I had an MRI which which reveled a reverse Lordis curve and a bulge at c5 c6, also some minor bone spurs in Thoracic. I have been to many doctors, Neuro who said to take Gabapitin, which I do an night, physical therapy , Ortho doctor who said that the MRI in writing was not accurate to what he saw when I brought him the images. Acupuncturist (who is also a former gallbladder and liver surgeon) thinks that the doctors need to listen to me because he thinks something is wrong that no one is looking at. I am in chronic pain and I get light headed and feel like I m being crushed and strangled (literally, I don t know any other way to describe it, it feels like I m not getting enough blood in my head), it is very prominent and makes me feel like I m going to pass out. Had heart checked at ER (said it was fine), Thyroid (normal), barium swallow (normal), stool sample was normal after treating C-diff infection following surgery w/ Flagyl. It is so bad now to start and getting worse.

Though you are married for 1 year and 4 months, you are sincerely trying for pregnancy for last 6 months only. If you are above 25 years of age, it is the time now that you start investigating both of you. You may not carry all the investigations straight a way. Initially try to find evidence of your egg release. Though in the market home kits are available, I would advise you initially to get the evidence by ultrasonography. This will ensure whether you are ovulating or not; and if you are ovulating, it will inform you the day of your ovulation (egg release). Egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 24 hours. Hence, a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is fertile window. Then get husbands semen examination done for the quality and quantity of the sperms. If both these investigation reports are within normal range, try to plan your intercourse at and around the day of ovulation. Lying on your back for about an hour after the intercourse is advisable. After intercourse, some amount of semen does flow out passively, it is hardly 10% to 20% of the total semen; so not an issue. To minimize this flow of semen, the penis should not be with Chat Doctor.  Let it slip out of vagina passively when it is placid.  If you fail to conceive even after six months fair trial like this, get Hysterosalpingography and Laparoscopy done to find out the condition and patency of the tubes and uterus. However, if you are above 30 years of your age, get both of you investigated completely without delay. Report then to your Infertility consultant for further advice. You may ask me a Direct question on this forum with all these reports uploaded. "}

First you should have not got all the 4 wisdom tooth removed in one sitting. You should get one removed at one time or two (one upper and one lower) of the same side in one sitting. Now as per your question. You have pain in lower left side as it was the only impacted tooth, there must have been more trauma to that region while removing that tooth, so it takes more time to heal and so more time for pain and swelling to subside... If you have a hard ball over your cheek it may be due to underlying infection and inflammation as well as mouth opening gets reduced due to same reasons. I would suggest you to take the full course of medicines which must be prescribed to you by your dentist and do mouth opening exercises like - Trying to open your mouth as much as you can under limits of pain toleration.-Other is tried to take your tongue out of moutChatDoctorpletely... These exercises will have an additive effect in improving your mouth opening along with medicines. If the condition still doesn't improve visit your dentist for follow up .

Partial seizures can cause tongue and facial numbness. T2W hyperintense lesions on MRI of brain are not suggestive of a serious disease. As of now, you should be on anti-seizure medications, such as oxcarbazepine. This would reduce the chances of seizure recurrence. I hope it helps.

I had not done anything to hit my arm, and had not been outside to get bitten by any bugs. While I watched over the next 5 minutes, the bulge on my arm proceeded to move toward my wrist, and form a bulge that was 5 inches long, 3 inches wide and about 1 inch high. I went to the pharmacy to purchase Benydryl, thinking it might be a bug bite, but the pharmacist told me to go to the emergency room. The doctor there said that it was a burst blood vessel, and it would form a bruise and go away. It did look like a lot of bruising over the next few days, but after two weeks now, the bulge is still there and is very tender. The bruising look has almost gone away. Perhaps my prolonged bed rest had something to do with it, or the extended time that I was using the cell phone.

My past period started on 1/2/13. We had sex once a day from 1/8-1/16. On 1/17 I had severe cramping-which I don t recall ever experienced in the middle of my cycle (only during my period). Then today (21st) I noticed a puddle of slightly white/clear discharge on my underwear. I thought maybe this discharge was a sign that I am currently ovulating...took ovulation predictor test-came back negative. What do you think this discharge is?", "output": "HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern. See, the ovulation predictor kit is not always 100 % reliable. Also, the discharge increases AFTER ovulation. It is at its peak just before your period is due. That could be one reason you got a negative test. You had ALREADY ovulated. However, you are still in the clear since you were sexually active during the requisite time. Being sexually active well past your expected ovulatory dates will also increase chances of pregnancy. Another possibility is conditions like POD which are keeping you from normal ovulationTake care."}

I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I would like to know more about your fever to avoid unnecessary antibiotics. As most of the fevers are viral and do not need antibiotics. Unnecessary antibiotics cause no benefit and sometimes may cause harm.2. If your fever is more than 101 F (without paracetamol), then it is a significant fever. In that case, I would suggest you to follow-up with your doctor who will examine you again, may suggest investigations like complete blood counts, and may prescribe an antibiotic, if necessary.3. In asthmatic patients, simple viral throat infections can also last longer, as compared to other non-asthmatic individuals. 4. For my such patients, I do not prescribe antibiotics unless patients show signs of bacterial infections like toxic look, yellow, thick expectoration, yellow/pus-like spots over pharynx, possibility of bacterial sinusitis, etc. If in doubt, I usually suggest complete blood counts, which may suggest type of infection the patient could have. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good recovery and the best of the health ahead.

The dentist was consulted who told me about some infection.  He did filling on 3 teeth and asked to take Augmentin 625 mg (twice a day) for 5 days and also advised for having extra Calcium tabs.  A month back, I started feeling pain in teeth where filling was done.  I consulted the same dentist and took Amoxycillin 625 mg tabs for 6 days and the pain stopped. However, I am having blood in salvia mainly in the early morning. I also find blood signs in nostrils when I sneeze in the morning. I am taking other medicines for Blood Pressure including blood thinning tablets (Ascard-75 mg) and Citanew (10 mg) for heart rythem. What may be the cause of blood in salvia and what is your advice..?", "output": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint in case if you have pain in any of the tooth that is filled, and you are taking antibiotics for it, but the pain will not be relieved as it seems that the nerves have been exposed during making a cavity in the tooth to remove decay and retain the filling material and the nerve irritation and inflammation is the cause of pain. For this consult your dentist again and get an x-ray done and in case if the nerves are exposed removal of the filling followed by Root canal treatment can resolve the problem. The blood in saliva can be due to infection in the gums causing inflammation of the gums and bleeding which is evident through saliva. While in case if there is blood spots through nostrils it is possible that due to hard sneezing there is some rupture of minor blood vessels leading to blood spots. The other thing that is possible is that your blood pressure is rising leading to bleeding, or it can also be a side effect of certain medicine that you are taking. You should consult a dentist and get evaluated and also get the blood pressure checked. In case if the blood pressure is high consult your treating physician so that he can alter the doses of the medicine as per the requirement. In case if allergic reaction is found change of the antibiotics can help. Hope this information helps.

I did a years worth of chemotherapy and 6 weeks straight of radiation. They moved my right ovary over so it won t get damaged from radiation. I ve been in a relationship for over 6 yrs now and me and my partner really want to conceive. I am getting a little doubtful. It is hard for me to find out exactly when, or if I do ovulate because I don t have normal periods (every month ) my period only comes when it wants to and out of nowhere. I finally had a period on my own last month which really surprised me and made me happy. It s February 20th today and I should have started my period by now but haven t yet.

Since I did have a period last month does that mean I can and do still ovulate", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that after getting treated for Ewing's sarcoma by chemotherapy and radiation therapy, you have had a sub fertility and this is due to hormonal imbalance. If your periods are not regular then please consult your gynecologist and follow treatment to regularize it. Ovulation occurs 14 days before periods in most women. However since your periods are irregular therefore it is not easy to predict ovulation in your case. There are home test kits available to monitor ovulation or do ultrasound follicle monitoring around the time of ovulation. When your periods are regular then you might use the ovulation kit to know exactly when you are most fertile and conceive. If there is persisting difficulty in monitoring ovulation then there is a chance of pregnancy by artificial reproductive techniques. Please do not worry."}

In particular, she should avoid exposure to paints since the paints contain heavy metals and lead. This may affect the cognitive function of the baby. She should avoid volatile and/or irritant fluids as they will diminish the oxygen she is breathing and will lead to improper growth of the fetus. Amines are not good. Moreover, if the fumes are harmful to the baby, they should be totally avoided. It depends upon to which fluids she is exposed to. The best strategy is better to err on safer side.

I did MRI and other tests. There is nothing in there as every thing is normal except for a minimal disk bulge at D9-D10 Levels. I have since started going to physio therapy and it has eased a bit. However my sacral joint pains when I do certain exercises. I am unable to sit for long hours.....It pains in between sacrum and cocyx region....but the pain wears of if i dont strain it much. I have been taking medication and exercising on a daily basis. Can you suggest if any thing can be done to help my problem", "output": "Hello, I would like to suggest that you do a form of therapy called AROMATHERAPY or WATER EXERCISES.  Your doctor may be able to actually such therapy for you that insurance should cover, but I will give you an exercise that you may do ON YOUR OWN without even taking formal therapy, and it is, in general, an AMAZING exercise for the vast majority of my back pain patients such as yourself.  It is called WATER JOGGING and no simpler exercise exists in the pool for back pain.  Simply find a pool (public or private) with water that is approximately waist high or even a slight bit above and start JOGGING IN PLACE for segments of 5-10 seconds each with rest periods as necessary.  Depending upon your stamina and specific situation with respect to other medical problems. I recommend doing at least 5 min. of this type of exercise daily for 1 week then, slowly increasing the # minutes week by week until you are capable of sustaining 10-15 minutes of water jogging every other day with 1 day of the week as your OFF day.  You can combine land based exercises along with this recommendation.  However, keep this exercise going for a minimum of 3-4 weeks before either increasing the total overall duration of the exercise of going from 5-10 second intervals out to 15-20 seconds with rests of at least 2 minutes in between sets.  This is such a great exercise to do because it allows a full range of motion with very little interference from gravity which means the RANGE OF MOTION of the hip and leg joints is much fuller and causes much less pain than by doing the same exercise on land.  Its remarkable how my patients tell them they feel after just 1-2 sessions of this exercise.  You will find it absolutely mind-boggling! Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. "}

I am 5 1 135 lbs and eat very healthy. I exercise 2 times a week with cardio and weight lifting. I got my test results back to check liver enzymes and my ALT is high. The range should be 6-29 and mine is 35. I looked back on my previous tests when I was under another doctor s care BEFORE I was taking cholesterol medication and it was 28. The range they showed though was from 0-40 as acceptable, not 6-29. This most recent test was done because I was diagnosed with a benign hemangioma on my liver which was found incidentally looking for something else, a benign fatty mass on my kidney. I am also wondering if my high ALT is the reason my glucose is so high. It is 119. Before when I was tested under my other doctor when my ALT was low my glucose was low too. It was 92 so I feel there could be a connection between the 2 readings. So while my cholesterol is low, 174, due to the statins, my ALT and glucose are high as well. My current cholesterol reading after going through a life style change WITHOUT statins is 264. Do you think it s the statins that are causing my high ALT readings? Or is it the benign hemangioma on my liver? I am also concerned my medications are affecting my glucose negatively. I ate less healthy when my glucose was low. Now that I take care of myself, it s higher. The only difference I can see is statins.", "output": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your ALT level is normal. No need to worry about your ALT level. There is minor lab to lab variation and instrument and kit wise variation in result. So no need to worry about ALT. Statin is not responsible for that. Liver hematoma is accidental finding, and it is also not responsible. Statin does not increase the blood glucose level. Take low fat diet with high amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

I appreciate your concern for your beloved fathers' problem. Since your father did not respond to Sat baths (warm water wash) and other medicines, so he needs a surgical procedure under general anesthesia to remove the fistula. Since fistulas are known to recur if not excised properly a histogram (dye injected from the external opening to the inner opening to locate the tract should be done first.

It involves cutting open the entire length of the fistula, from the internal opening to the external opening. The surgeon will flush out the contents and flatten it out.

I went to primary care and they gave me a prescription antihistamine, even though i was adament that i did not think this is an allergy.

A detailed liver function test (LFT) would have helped to secure this diagnosis if the alkaline phosphatase was also raised. But as you mentioned no obvious jaundice, it is important to know that the other LFT parameters such as the enzymes are normal. An ultrasound liver/GB is important at this stage.

First I want to tell you that masturbation is an innocent, absolutely normal human sexual response. According latest research men who have often practiced masturbation are less prone to prostate cancer in later ages. Therefore, Do not worry about masturbation. It does not have side effects.  It is absolutely normal and harmless.  However, the fear or guilt you have towards masturbation has resulted to create your anxiety. I believe those non-specific above-mentioned symptoms are also related to anxiety. When you have anxiety and do not know a way to solve your problems it coverts into depression. Your suicidal thoughts are part of your depression.  Dear reader, you have to understand for what you are worrying is meaningless.  Almost all men have practiced masturbation in their lives. Your problem is you just overlook at your problem. Also, all your above-mentioned symptoms are due to your anxiety, therefore,treating your symptoms mean in other words treating your build up anxiety.  Also, men when they are sexually aroused fluids from prostate and Cowper glands start leaking through the urethra.  This is what you have seen as semen and during sexual excitement leaking of these fluids is again normal.  You do not have to suicide. You are a healthy young man. My advice is you have to see a psychiatrist immediately. He is the right person to help you.  Believe me you life will be good and happy. Stop worrying and consult a psychiatrist soon. Good luck!"}

Preterax doesn't cause infertility. There are few reasons why you are not able to conceive.1. Age is the first and foremost. Unfortunately, the number of eggs in the ovaries are constant and keeps getting depleted from the time of monarch. At 52 years of age, the number of remaining eggs in the ovary is very, very less that even with IVF it is difficult to harvest a good number.  Age also compromises the quality of eggs which is very important for the success of IVF.2. Blocked fallopian tube makes it almost impossible for pregnancy to happen in natural way. Its unfortunate that one of your tube is blocked, and the other has been removed.3.

Thank you!", "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The Althea contraceptive contains a combination of estrogen, progesterone and an ingredient that is an anti-an Chat Doctor.  You take the pill every day (at the same time if possible) every day for three weeks of the month.  For one week a month, you take no pills, and should have your period start during this time.  You should start the pill on the first day of your next period, and it will protect against pregnancy immediately.  Birth control pills are 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, and usually give you a short, light period every 28 days or so. So you finish the three weeks of pills, and then start a new pack exactly 7 days after you finish the old one. The birth control injection, called Demo Proverb, has only the hormone progesterone in it, so it doesn't have any known benefits for your skin.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You should go for investigations to know about the basic cause of irregular periods. It is mostly due to hormonal imbalance and the treatment depends on the type of imbalance. It could be due to ovarian/thyroid problem/pituitary gland abnormality. USG or hormonal assay helps in understanding.Sometimes ovulation stimulation can be done and conception can be planned, or test tube baby can be tried. Still in those cases knowledge of basic problem helps in pregnancy care and normality. In case there is no abnormality noted, the menstrual regularity can be attained by 3 cyclical courses of hormonal treatment. Here ovulation is judged by LH surge test followed by unprotected sex from the day of positive test for 5 days at a stretch. You should consult a gynecologist for all needful advice, investigations, and management. Please don't worry. Any health problem has a solution in this era of modern medicine.

He is diabetic and does have heart problems. What are is risk facture for this operation?", "output": "Hi, thanks for your question. Amputations in diabetics are quite commonly performed, mainly for limbs that are dangerous (severely infected), or functionless. Regarding your concern about the risk of the operation, the risks can be divided into short and long term complications. Short term:1. Bleeding, which can be avoided with careful dissection and ligation2. Anaesthetic risks - this is relevant to your information regarding his ECHO, I'm assuming his ejection fraction is around 15-20% which indicates that his heart reserves is quite limited, and he can suffer from low blood pressure leading to a heart attack or a stroke during the operation. These risks are avoided by staying away from blood pressure lowering Chat Doctor.  I'm sure the anesthesiologist will inform him about their plan of attack to avoid sucChatDoctorplications. Long term complications:1. Wound breakdown - diabetic have a higher risk of non-healing wounds, I advise for strict control of his blood sugars in the immediate days following the operation2. Phantom pain - a known risk for amputees, having sensation or even pain at the amputated limbs. However, we generally recommend amputation as a last resort and only if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks. If an infected foot is left alone, the infection can harbor and ascend up, affecting more than just the foot."}

In my opinion iron supplements are known to cause constipation or hard stools. Constipation is routinely seen complaint in pregnancy.

Nothing to worry. It will subside by following the above measures. Coming to vaginal lips swelling check for any infection like white discharge or itching or any high BP. The swelling can also be related to excessive straining at stools. If everything is normal the swelling might be considered physiological as some swelling of vaginal lips might be there in pregnancy and subsides after delivery. But iron preparations might not be associated with swelling of vaginal lips. Anyways nothing to worry as such. Prevention of constipation is important to avoid other problems. Hope this helps.

Its been about a month now. It started when a dentist put me to sleep to extract a wisdom tooth last month.", "output": "Hello, Thanks for posting your query. Constant dizziness followed with extraction of wisdom tooth may be due to-unhealed extraction socket. Overstrained work schedule, anxiety and stress can also cause this.

It is logical that you can assume it to be aneurysm again as you have had it before. However, if it was aneurysm, you should be feeling symptoms like pulsations, numbness over the area etc. What you are experiencing is a sharp and dull pain episodes in the cheek area which seems like pain from infection of the oral cavity or due to sinusitis. It could also be pain related to Trigeminal or Facial nerve. I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity to look for presence of infection in the area. If dentist clears you for any loci of infection, an ENT specialist or physician can examine you for sinus or nerve related problems.

Basically you have symptoms of palpitations and fast heart rate when you exert. This may be related to cardiac cause also. When the heart arteries are narrowed, when you ever the heart nets faster to cope up with the demand.

This will show whether the heart really gets fast more than normal range during exertion. Next I would also like to see a thyroid profile on you.

Based on your symptoms, the cause is likely due to a muscle strain or pull in the adductor muscles of your thigh (groin muscles).

Your best bet at this point is to stretch the area regularly, holding each stretch for 15-30 seconds and performing this as much as possible during your waking hours. I would also suggest using an Over the counter anti-inflammatory such as alive or ibuprofen. In the next few days you should use more regularly, and then you can gradually stop using these.

Thanks in Advance.", "output": "Hi Narmada, Onset of acne in adult age usually points towards a hormonal derangement. To get the same confirmed a hormonal work up and a pelvic ultrasound needs to be done. Usually adult onset acne does not respond to topical therapy alone. A course of oral anti acne medicines like azithromycin, isotretinoin needs to be taken along with hormonal pills. The same can only be prescribed after a thorough consultation with dermatologist. In the meanwhile you can start with these1) continue using salicylic acid face wash2) as your skin has become sensitive, use a mild moisturizer and sunscreen. You may use acne moist moisturizer and sun cote sunscreen3) use benzoyl peroxide 2.5 percent(Bengal ac gel) in daytime and Darlene gel in night. Apply these medicines only over acne lesions and do not rub the medicine. Too much rubbing or excess application can irritate the skin. Chances of irritation of skin are quite high with benzoyl peroxide 5 percent. So I would not advise you to use it without a proper skin analysis.4) get your comedones extracted regularly.

I recently got a tattoo from a pretty reputable place. What are the chances I could have contracted Hep-C from this tattoo? also I recently got the tattoo when should I get tested if I had any concerns?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Hepatitis C virus is transmitted only by blood. Unlike much other blood borne viruses (like HIV), virtually any source of blood or blood products seems to be capable of carrying the virus, even if the source is indirect, like for example - a used razor. This makes hepatitis C far more transmissible than most other blood-borne viruses. Hepatitis C virus is most frequently transmitted through large or repeated direct percutaneous exposures to infected blood. Hence, there is a high possibility of contacting infection with Hepatitis C virus by means of getting tattoo as it involves repeated skin pricks. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."}

The finding of a few simple cysts on an ultrasound in and of itself would not warrant further evaluation. The findings of a cyst that would warrant further evaluation would be large size (right around where his are or greater), complexity of the cyst by imaging which would indicate that it is not just fluid-filled or any masslike characteristics. If the original imaging was done in May 2011 and there has been no change in the size, it would seem unlikely to be of any significance. To reassure yourself, I would suggest that you request an MRI to further characterize the cyst as well as urine cytology.

There can be different strains of MRSA because there are different strains of staph. The MRSA are harder to treat because not so many antibiotics are effective enough. Staph can affect anybody. The fact that it is MRSA doesn't change that. People with weaker immune systems are more likely to get infected. Or people who have open wounds like abrasions or cut. The bacteria can get in through the wound and cause infection. The best things to do to prevent transmission is to wash your hands frequently and clean up areas, using gloves, where your daughter may have touched the infected burn on. Hope this helps."}

As you said POD is the reason for irregular periods. Why don't you correct the reason for POD ? Pod does not allow ovulation & once pregnancy is reason for many abortions, especially in first 3 myths, due to hormone imbalance. Weight is the most important reason for PRO.

Check your Thyroid status / Blood sugars / serum prolactin these are altered in POD.

Regards Ann", "output": "Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you have fractured the neck of the femur at multiple places what was the mode of treatment applied has to be understood? Have you undergone any surgery for the same or not? As fracture at the neck of femur is a very intense place and needs a proper rehabilitation plan. Physical therapy needs to be very different as you are a trekking person and needs to understand your musculoskeletal requirements. Also, what was the mechanism of fracture? Was it a fall or a direct injury needs a thorough understanding. If it is a direct impact then the muscles must have impacted very badly and also if it was a fall then understanding the lumbosacral region is required. As stiffness occurs due to the nerve pathology and needs a thorough assessment. In my clinical practice, dealing with sports injuries and others, with thorough understanding of the mechanism of injury and also the musculoskeletal requirements the therapy is induced and things works fine most of the time. In your case the rehabilitation process is little longer as it needs a proper stabilization of the hip joint since you are a trekking individual. Also, the gluteus and the internal & external rotators should be strong enough to hold the joint in space. Undergoing a balance board training helps to regain the joint proprioceptive mechanism and gives good nobility with stability.

I am Chat Doctor, MD. Read your query. That is a very significant question and I appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your query granuloma is where an infection may have happened once, as your doctor said, in the last 10 years or before. This infection could have been anything like a tuberculosis to maybe some minor lesion. Now the body fights infections on its own. So the infection may have never come to the surface. But the body must have fought off the infection. However, some damage may have been left back. Now the body usually responds by depositing calcium in such spots- whether in brain, or in any other body part. This deposition occurs over a long period of time-hence we say maybe the infection occurred 10 years back. The lesion in itself is inactive. The problem however is that it is in brain. So if the lesion is calcified in brain, especially in cortex, it makes her prone to seizures. The brain works on electrical signals. The calcific spot forms a lesion that changes this electrical field and makes it abnormal. This abnormal electrical field may be going on, and may be under control. But with right set of conditions, a seizure can develop-This set of conditions can include-a lack of sleep excess coffee/tea staring at blinking lights too long too long television gazing etc Brain surgery should be avoided as far as possible. However, you can discuss with the doctor the need of prophylactic antiepileptic Chat Doctor.  Personally, I would avoid them till at least the first seizure episode. Before that just avoid the triggers. Testing a Manitou test, ESR, TB Quantifier gold test may help. I hope this helps you. Inform the reports mentioned above/if any other, so I can be of help further. I have given you the answer to the maximum considering the information provided.

I am suffering from extreme fatigue - not present last week - resting heart rate of 88 - normally in 70s. Very cold. Out of breath on stairs, carrying or lifting does not seem to impact me. Unusual amount of thirst and low blood pressure 103/60. Triglycerides high which cardiologist attributes to months of minimal exercise- waiting for hip otherwise cholesterol 170. Before I left the hospital, they said I was close to requiring a transfusion but they decided against it. Anemia? Diabetes? Any thoughts? This is the longest period two months of little or no physical activity. Super out of shape?", "output": "Your symptoms could point towards hypothyroidism. The surgery could have put stress on your body which unmasked the effects of low thyroid hormone. This is made worse by your anemia.I would order thyroxine and TSH levels to confirm the diagnosis and possibly an ultrasound of the thyroid to ensure no structural issues. I would also order calcium levels as the parathyroid hormones can also be affected. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, you may have to be started on some medications to normalize the thyroid levels. You will feel good as new once the levels are adequate."}

The common branch lies in the center of the palm from which the branches separate and go on to supply the fingers. Tablets can only help in relieving you from the neuropathic pain though not completely, but they have no role whatsoever in regaining sensation. You should get in touch with a plastic surgeon as early as possible because accurate nerve repair is the key to regaining sensation over the numb areas and would take place over months after repair. In the absence of nerve repair, there would be a very slow regain of protective sensation only over a span of many months and that too is incomplete."}

This will gradually improve with physiotherapy. So if pain is unbearable and more with activities, he should definitely be evaluated for heart diseases. So consult his cardiologist and have a look at stents whether they are properly working or not. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

You need to stop doing or using anything new and see if you are feeling any better. Once this episode subsides then you can start using one thing at a time to see what you are allergic to.

It was, I think, my second seizure in 4 mos. I have never had seizures before. I have a long history of an anxiety disorder, and severe migraines. I have a history of breast cancer, and a CT scan came back negative for tumor. The first time I thought I had a severe anxiety attack because at the time I was home along, but I still do not know what happened that caused me to cause an ambulance for myself. Very untypical of me as I would never go to the hospital for myself unless absolutely necessary. On a 1/2 of this past week it happened in front of my boyfriend and what he described was not passing out, not anxiety, it was a seizure. One minute I was sitting up at my desk talking to him, and the next thing I knew I was sitting on an ottoman in my house and he had called an ambulance. He said I was dead....I went into convulsions, I curled my hands and moaned, my body became rigid/almost hard, foam came from my mouth and my face was contorted, then I got very quiet. That is when he thought I had quit breathing. The ER person on the phone with him told him to feel my chest and check if I was breathing and he may need to begin CPR if I wasn t. He said they would talk him through it. Just when he went to check me I flew up off the floor and against the wall. He put me on the ottoman, which is flat, and sat there with me until the ambulance arrived. He said I was moving his fingers apart and pulling on them in a strange manner. I remember nothing....all I remember is he was trying to talk to me but I did not understand what he was telling me, what had happened, and why it seemed we were going somewhere but I couldn t figure out why. He held the picture of my niece/nephews up to my face (a picture I fell up against and hit with my head), and I had no idea who they were. I knew my name, but I did not know my boyfriend s name - and we have been together for 7 years. I didn t know where I was. I used to take medication for chronic pain management for something like 10 years (started with severe migraines in my early 30 s as well, then degenerative disc disease in my c-spine and l-spine. My Oncologist (who had treated me for breast cancer in 1995 and dealt in palliative medicine, was all too willing to write my pain medications until they started cracking down on them....now it is a lot more difficult and I have had to take Tramadol instead. Now I wonder if the Tramadol is causing this.", "output": "Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The description of the episodes seem like convulsions or seizures. Tramadol increases the risk of getting seizures. However, you need to be evaluated to find out the underlying cause of seizures. MRI brain-epilepsy protocol and EEG would be helpful.

Dementia is a progressive condition of the brain. It involves loss of functions of a number of important brain areas and there is an over all reduction in the size of the brain, too.  You may need to consult a Neurologist and a Psychiatrist. The combined approach will help him with the symptoms of Dementia as well as the behavioral problems. The clinical evaluation will help you and the doctors understand the severity of the condition and diagnose any additional problems.  As mentioned above, Dementia is a progressive condition. This means the damage to the nerve cells in his brain (central nervous system) will be on going. There are a few medicines that can help him slow down the progress of the illness, but it is expected to progress further. You may need to make arrangements for a caretaker for him, as his wife is also aged, and may not be able to take care of him alone. It has been a common observation that the caretakers of Dementia and BPSD patients show signs of burn-out frequently.  I hope this helps a bit. And I wish you good luck with the process.

The coloring disappears spontaneously in a few days.  Brief periods(a few seconds) of not breathing are common in normal full-term infants.  Periods of not breathing for more than 15 second scan happen in normal newborns.  If the hospital felt your baby was stable and healthy, then there are no more tests that need to be done.  Hope I have answered your query.  If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help.  Arnold EDD, MD, FLAP"}

Fertilization between the egg and the sperm takes place in the fallopian tube. Due to beading, the conditions may not be normal for the egg and sperm to fertilize in the tube. The possibility of abnormal implantation (ectopic) has also been explained to you. I am sorry to hear that the first IVF procedure failed for you. If not IVF, CSI (Intro cytoplasmic sperm injection) can also be tried after assessing your case details. After surgery (trans cervical recanalization) if feasible, pregnancy chances can reach 50%.

Christinas gynecologist performed an exam including ultrasound over 2 years ago and found nothing unusual. What are the chances of Christina having ovarian cancer?

It is unlikely for gastritis to be responsible for ovarian cancer. However, if there is cancer ovary in her family then your wife might do an ovarian cancer tumor marker test. There is a blood test called CA 125 which is a cancer marker test for ovarian cancer. This is a simple test and tells a possibility of cancer in the ovary. This is not related to gastritis.

I can understand your situation and problem. Your white spots on tongue are mostly due to steroid injection. Steroids cause low immunity and candida (fungal) infection in mouth. So better not to take systemic steroids. Instead of this, consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only.

I had an unusual episode of vertigo for a week 2 years ago - woke up running into walls, dizziness & nausea. It finally passed after a week, so this may be unrelated to present. 10 months ago I developed a sudden subtle itching in my scalp. It then moved to severe itching in my hands & feet, then torso, back & finally arms, legs. The itching comes on worst at night. Went to multiple drs. & was finally told I have dermatographism/chronic pressure urticaria with an unknown idiology but was an auto immune response. About 2 months ago I started feeling deep in my right ear like I was going to get an ear infection when I laid down to go to sleep but I never woke with one. Both ears started to take turns sharing this sensation at nights. Then, 3 weeks ago I woke up with the sensation radiating down my jaw on the right. I figured I had finally gotten the ear infection. I went to the dr. & he said ears were fine but throat looked like had infection. I did not have a sore throat, sinuses or any issues to suggest this. I was put on augmentin. 2 days later I started spiking 104+ fevers & got very weak barely able to walk/talk & got rash on legs. Went back to dr & tested positive for strep & mono both & antibiotic was switched to azithromycin & our on methylprednisolone & told to keep temp down for next 24-48 hours to reduce infection risk. 2 days later fever was gone all day. Around 9pm I laid down to watch a movie & immediately felt like I was burning up from the inside out, not like a typical fever. I became concerned because did not feel right. I made some calls & was told was just infection & to take ibuprofen & go to sleep. I woke with itchy legs at 4am, which I was used to with the urticaria. Itched it out & went bsck to sleep. When I woke up in the morning, my cheeks were flush, skin was bright red & hot & had a rash all over my body. Went back to dr & was told had scarlet fever. Antibiotic was switched for a 3rd time. After ther steroid, the radiating feeling down my jaw stopped, but the ear pain is constant in one or both ears still & ranges in severity. There has been a lot if light tingling in my temporal area, left side of cheek more than right, top of head to the point I became concerned again & went to ER. Blood tests had some low/high levels but not enough to be remarkable. MRI was done & my braces threw artifact on the scans so difficult to read. Frustrated, felt dumb & still had no answers. A couple days later I had ringing in my right ear a few times for a few seconds then light drumming in my left ear once for a few seconds. I went to ENT-pa last week, recited whole story, checked ears, nose, throat & stated all clear must just be the alignment of my jaw. This did not sound right to me as only effected my jaw once for a few days. Left frustrated again. My ears sensations are getting worse when I lay down it seems. I have also had an area in my right side in the same place & 2 areas on my left side that have had twinges of pain on & off but not severe. I did have a few days of high stomach pains that would last 30-60 mind but hen go away. I noticed tge past couple days tiny muscle spasms in my left hand, left leg & right foot. My neck on both sides has had little twinges of pain but not severe & comes & goes. My heart has started to feel discomfort past couple days, especially if I try to lay on my left side. Tonight, I m just afraid to go to sleep & developing a light flushing in cheeks it feels & little rashes that come & itch then fade some but still have a speckle presence. No fever. I.

Do note if there were any factors before the hair loss started. Most common are Dan Chat Doctor. Females also may be affected by a genetic type if it runs in the family. Also do note if you have hair loss anywhere else in the body. These causes need to be considered and treated first as they affect hair growth. You need to take a nutritious diet, well-balanced, with enough fluids and rest. Avoid stress. Consult a dermatologist regarding the type of hair loss you are facing, and also get some tests to check your hemoglobin, iron and thyroid levels. For now, you may start hair supplements daily containing biotin. Also apply a hair serum like Recite or Karate. They need to be continued at least for 2-3 months. You will notice the hair fall reducing and new hair growth slowly. It depends on your hair cycle. Be sure to see your doctor regarding the possible cause of your hair fall. Further treatments will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation, depending on your results. Hope this guides you"}

I had the radiosurgery done last March 2009. MRI was done every 6 months for one year then every year with no significant changes but my MRI that was done this year recently last 2/21/2013 rebealed an enhancing mass at the left parafalcine vertex is slightly increased in size since the prior exam, measuring 3.5x3.5x2.1cm formerly 3.3x2.4x2.3 cm at a similar level. The mass has broad dural base, compatible with a meningioma. As previous, the mass appears heteregeneous in its superior aspect with GRE hypointensity suggesting a possible calcification. There is a stable degree of mild surrounding vasogenic edema. No new enhancing lesions are visualized.I am waiting for a neurosurgeon consult. I was told the radiosurgery is ony a one time treatment. If craniotomy is the trreatment option for now, how dangerous the surgery can be? Are there major blood vessels involved in the location of the mass? How fast is the recovery after surgery and what are expected neurological deficits. Please advise, Im really scared about the surgery. Thank you, appreciate your response.", "output": "Hi, As you have told, you are suffering from a meningioma presently measuring 3.5x3.5x2.1\u00a0cm which was earlier 3.3x2.4x2.3 cm in left parafalcine vertex location. Coming to your specific question on surgery, any surgery to do with the head is not simple. However, in your condition (meningioma), most surgeries are safe with minimal associated complications. Further, there are no major blood vessels in that part of the brain where the meningioma has formed. The recovery in your surgery will be real fast, and you will be able to do almost every thing as you are doing now. Your doctor may give you few medicines immediately after the surgery. Please consult a neurosurgeon, and I am sure you will be cured soon. Hope this helps."}

Tobacco chewing, smoking and excess intake of tea and coffee can also be contributing factor. You should consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and in case of fungal infection along with maintaining good Oral hygiene you will have to take antifungal medication like Statin mouthwash and clotrimazole lozenges.

It started 2 years ago with a gradual onset of non-specific right side testicular pain. I received a physical exam and was told nothing was wrong. The pain persisted on and off for months until finally it was so bad I went to the ER and received an ultrasound. The doctor informed me I had an epididymal cyst which becomes inflames at times and could cause pain and told me to take Motrin. Well, since then it has gotten overall better with random bouts here and there, the medication seems to make no difference at all. Ive visited another doctor and a urologist who have both told me extreme pain isnt common for the diagnosis. The other day I woke up with extreme extreme pain in my right testicle. It seemed to change upon moving positions but for the most part felt like someone was squeezing my spermatic cord every 15 or so seconds, very bad pain. I managed to sleep it off and felt fine the next day. Then today out of nowhere it began again in the middle of the day and got much worse. I have noticed no swelling or change physically when looking at my testicles. I was wondering if partial torsion is a possibility. Tonight I was in such pain I was debating going to the ER but talked myself down from it. I dont believe it to be epididymal pain as the pain is much higher up in the spermatic cord near the groin and I can emulate the pain by rubbing the cord high up much further than the epididymas. The pain is very intense, but from what I read not torsion intense as I can walk and am not on the floor crying or vomiting as I have heard is usually the case. I have no pain urinating and have had no pain ejaculating. Is it possible to have partial torsion that can come and go?

A detailed clinical musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As mentioned in your history about the normal x-ray and pain still persists while bending the knee, then an or tho clinical assessment is needed, as your pain sounds more of a soft tissue injury than a bony one. So x-ray cannot show anything except the bones which appeared normal. Your or tho may also advise you for MRI of knee, which will help in addition to see the soft tissue status. As pain during straightening the knee is related to the soft tissue injury and should get assessed. Based on the diagnosis, you will be recommended for simple painkillers and physical therapy. With physical therapy, your pain will reduce by use of therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. Also, exercises will be performed to regain the ROM of the knee joint and also the strength of the muscles. In my clinical experience, I have seen cases with such injuries, and they respond well to the medication and physical therapy. By 2-3 weeks of time, they have optimum functionality without pain.

{"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "Heya i have been suffering with severe kidney infections for the last few years. However i think it may be cystitis . I have the implanon bar now in my arm 2 and a half years. It has only dawned on me recently that the implanon may be the cause of it. I suffer from these infections many times through the year and it seems to come more often when I get my period. What actually happens is I can feel the kidney infection/cystitis/ uti coming on and I get excrutiating severe pains. These pains would start inside the opening of my vagina, it would effect urinating as sometimes it would be sore, i would feel like i have to urinate often. But most of the pain is inside my vagina and i get very sharp pains coming from my lower abdomin and all around my vaginal area inside. Usually within the next day or two i would get my period. However this is not always the case. I am getting very worried as the pain i experience isnt natural. I cannot go anywhere or do anything only stay in my bed with howater bottle. I am very concerned as I am only 20 and I can get many of these infections throughout the year. Also, I think sexual intercourse may not be helping as sometimes when i get these infections I would have had sex a day or two before hand. I really want t fing a solution to my problem, I take anti-biotics for this and although it clears the infection up in about a week or so the problem is still there as these infections are reoccurring regularly. I was wondering could the implanon bar be a cause of this? and if so I might change to the pill? is there a recommended pill for bladder/kidney/uti infections???", "output": "Hi, You are suffering from what we call recurrent UTI. It's not related to the arm implant. Since it is recurring frequently you need some investigations to find the cause. You need urine culture, vaginal swab culture, ultrasound of abdomen. Check your blood sugar. You may need an x-ray call voiding cystourethrogram to look for reflux of urine into the kidneys. If everything is normal you may be a person more susceptible for infection because of your genetic make-up. It may be related to sexual intercourse. Empty your bladder before and after intercourse. You might need to be put on long term prophylactic antibiotic. Consult a urologist."}

He has studied at university, is very talented musicically , and is very athletic and physically fit,  but has shown some extremes .He is 28 yrs and had been working  with GNS Science in field of Geo Physics. He seemed at times disorientated in the latter 6mths out of his working for 2yrs there.  We were very concerned and made inquiries  after concerns where our son was doing bizarre things like running  for hours late at night  or deciding to experiment with physics problems etc to excessive hours etc or seemed apprehensive . Also  lacking insight in some situations where things are appropiate or inappropriate.    In the past he had always been very courteous, responsible, sensitive to needs and peoples situations. So this was quite out of character and most unlike him, and made us realize something wasnt right with him. After making iquiries at his workplace we also  realized he had had treatment Larium  ( Malaria innoculation ) by his GNS Science Co as part of a prerequisite in case of posting in Indonesia.  We wondered if this could have triggered some of the behaviours now evident which point to possible Schizoprenia  especially Catatonic symtoms ( stationary in one position for lengthy periods) social withdrawal at times,explosive reactions, fear of cellphones , Internet, and not wanting to communicate or enter into any decisionmaking.  We have observed a deterioration and isolation, intolerance to light , curtains always drawn, repetitiveness and routine etc,   Because of the Privacy Act  we are not informed by his Dr or Psychologist and so we asked for a referral to privately have an assessment of his Mental state.   He is receiving some help from Psychological counsellors but we would like to see someone who could advise us on how to help our son recognize his need for specialist medical help as we also want to minimize areas of inaccurate diagnosis. We are his  parents and have been supporting him and caring for him but feel very shut out in helping for his recovery plan.

Visit any professional colleges, and you will find at least 10% students like your son, and they would be toppers. It is also common that parents don't like these. They want their child to be active, social, lovable etc. Second. Have you talked to your son about this? If not talk now. If yes, what is the outcome. Let me know. I consider this as normal now. Mind you, You cannot judge your son as schizophrenic or catatonic because you are not trained in that area. Nowadays people sit and play video games hours together without interruptions.

Sometimes high doses of these medications are required in order to see a significant response. If one medication is not enough to relieve your symptoms, the psychiatrist may decide to add a second medication to the regimen in an attempt to capture more of your symptoms. Cognitive behavioral psychotherapy may also help you with some symptom relief. Don't give up hope; there is help for you out there. Feel better and best of health to you."}

Gestational diabetes invariably does go away following the delivery. But these patients are prone to get T2 DM later in life. Blood glucose fasting 118 is abnormal, but falls in the pre-diabetic category. (FBG 108 to 125 mg & PP 141 to 199 mg, & HbA1c% 5.9 to 6.4). Therefore, presently there is no diabetes, however, you will have to take precautions like controlled diet, avoiding sweets (not too much), deep-fried foods, pastries, bakery items, foods made out of maid and high fat milk products. You will also have to exercise regularly and maintain near normal weight. Plus refrain form alcohol and smoking as well as colas. In other words by adapting a modified lifestyle you will be able to postpone or prevent the development of diabetes. Thanks."}

Urinary tract infection is a common ailment, specially in young females (due to poor personal hygiene and use of unclean washrooms). Urinary tract infections are commonly diagnosed by symptoms (high grade fever, increased frequency of urination, burning during urination, pain in the loin or lower abdomen etc.). Urine for routine examination can be used for diagnosis, which reveals increased pus cells or sometimes red blood cells. However, urine culture may not be positive always. This occurs when the individual has already been exposed to an antibiotic before the culture sample was collected. Responding to antibiotics may not always be a criterion for this and resistant strains are very common. Blood investigations have probably been advised to check the infection parameters or maybe for blood culture. In the meantime I would advise her to Chat Doctor.  Urinary alkalinize may help. Acetaminophen may be taken for fever (but not >3gm per day). Since she has anemia (deficiency of blood) she can take oral iron and folic acid supplementation. Please do consult your physician for further advise. Hope this helps you out."}

I will advise you to meet a general surgeon and get both these lumps/ cysts excised. It's a simple outdoor procedure done under local anesthesia.

The only real symptom has been this high fever, and he hasnt complained about anything else.  He did vomit once and it was greenish/yellowish and looked like mucus.  He is now on Amoxicillin for 10 days, and my big concern is that his fever is not going away.  It has been spiking in early evening and early morning as high as 103, so weve still been giving Advil/tylenol.  what do you think?  could there be a secondary infection or complications because we let it go for several days before treatment?", "output": "Hi, after going through the medical history I feel that the infection is resistant to Amoxicillin. Usually fever subsides within 1 or 2 days of antibiotic therapy. Unless the bacteria is resistant, it is not possible for the fever to be going on till now. The other possibility is that an entire diagnosis has been missed altogether. Why I say this because, Street can also be cultured from healthy people who are called as carriers, and they do not have symptoms because of this. Therefore, it may be co-incidental that we identified this carrier state when he might be actually down with something else.

Both, lung infection and bronchitis can cause similar kind of symptoms with chest pain. If all these are normal then no need to worry about major lung diseases.

If available, you could also opt for a mammoth biopsy if there is in your area. I am suggesting this since your FNA smears and your BIRDS categorization does not coincide together.

Thanks", "output": "If you truly have hepatitis C, it was just coincidence it was diagnosed at the same time as the glandular fever, not a cause or a result. You probably have had it all along, and your doctor did some tests to diagnose the glandular fever and found some abnormalities suggesting liver inflammation, which then caused him/her to check you for hepatitis C. It could have been there awhile as it often causes few symptoms. People go for years without noticing anything while it silently progresses into liver cirrhosis over decades. This is not AIDS and hepatitis C is rarely contracted via sex. It most often occurs with transfusions of blood or blood products, or from sharing needles to inject Chat Doctor.  Glandular fever can also cause inflamed liver, but if hepatitis C has definitely been diagnosed, you need to get it treated, even if the liver inflammation from the glandular fever got better.

I ve had previous DVT and about a stone overweight.", "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If you had a DVT before during pregnancy, you do have an increased risk of recurrence.  Women who have a history of DVT during pregnancy also should be on DVT prophylaxis to prevent clots if you don't already have one.  So you should see an OB or especially a dermatologist (high-risk specialist) who is comfortable prescribing Heparin (or similar medication) and you will need to begin preventative injections. However, DVT by definition is a deep vein thrombosis, which means the veins you can see are not DVDs.  If they become clotted, the treatment is warm compresses as much as possible, leg elevation and wearing support stockings.  So I do not think your symptoms now are due to DVT, however you do need to be on preventive medication for safety for the rest of the pregnancy.

Ideally speaking, when you miss a pill, you should take it the next day, along with the pill due on the next day as well i.e. two pills the next day, plus the remainder of the pack as prescribed. This you have already done, so no issues. However, the important thing is, to use a backup method, such as condoms, for the rest of the month, before beginning a new pack the following month. You mentioned that this was not done. However, the mild symptoms you mention, are mostly non-specific, and have nothing to do with missing a pill.

I then went to a Urologist, he did physical examination and advised that physically everything seems normal. Finally, he suggested a FNAC of both testes and Fertility Profile (LH, FSH , Prolactin and Testostorone).The fertility profile was normal. However, the FNAC results were not good. It shows presence of scattered sertoli cells & germ cells upto spermatids. Leydig Cells are also found. But mature sperms could not be found.

That means that there is no normal mature sperm in your ejaculation.  For in vitrofertilization we need a mature, motile, healthy sperm which is not available in your case.  So, first you have to take multivitamins and micronutrients a co-enzyme q10 which will definitely increases your sperm count and morphology and motility. Then invited fertilization will be an option.

At a young age everyone come across the situation you are having, and it is normal. The foreskin of penis slides forwards in the flaccid state and retracts back when you have an erection.

I once went into emergency having fever, chills and vomitting. Drs told me that i might have mild kidney infection and gave me oral antibiotics. I was ok till I had antibiotics, once its over i got back my dizziness. Doctors did a culture again and found I have <50,000 rods/ml so no antibiotics is necessary. I am having mild dizziness/ slight headedness. What could be the remedy?", "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. Let me first shed light on the rules of treating an infection, more specifically a urinary tract infection. As you experienced a return or relapse of symptoms as soon as you got off your antibiotics the reasons for the same could be the following:-Inadequate dosage used to treat the infection (a stronger dosage should have been advised)-Inadequate duration of use (should have been continued for a longer duration as infection was clearly still prevalent)-Inappropriate antibiotic used (the antibiotic used was not good enough to treat the infection)In such cases, a urine culture should be conducted (which was done) and one of the most effective antibiotics should be selected to treat the condition, for an adequate amount of time with an appropriate dosage. Now coming to the presence of a colony of 50,000. If you are not on the antibiotic, this colony count is only going to multiply and increase which would most certainly result in an infection again. If the antibiotic used was effective, the urine culture should have not reported any colonies or infection-causing organisms at all. I hope all this is clear. It is quite evident what has to be done. Please re-visit your doctor or another one, and select an antibiotic which is susceptible to your infection, and re-initiate a course of at least 7-10 days, and discontinue only once a repeat urine test has reported the absence of an infection. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications at: http://doctor.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/ Chat Doctor.  I would gladly help you. Best wishes."}

There are two types of stump pain mainly,1 Neuroma pain- it's a shooting pain sensation severe in consistency, and occurs on touching the stump. It occurs because formation of neuroma occurs at he cut end of the nerves. The solution are either desensitization therapy, or neuroma excision and buried in deep tissue surgically.2 The second type of pain is what is called as Phantom limb sensation and pain, here is the cortical part of brain that represented the amputee part causes false sensation of the limb in place and it's paining, this is quite hard to correct type of pain, and require more of psychological help rather than any surgical help. Before you consider these, please rule out stump infection as the cause of pain.

Should there be only c-section and hernia correction. please advise us.", "output": "No, an uncomplicated umbilical hernia should not necessarily create problems with your next pregnancy and delivery. Your history of 4th degree tear is much more concerning than the hernia, and you have already overcome that issue. If your umbilical hernia becomes more problematic (stuck out or painful), you could potentially require surgery. Hernia surgery in pregnancy is generally low risk and most patients tolerate it well. Overall, I wouldn't worry about your umbilical hernia until it becomes an issue. Many women have uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries with these. The only time I would be potentially worried about your hernia is during pushing. The abdominal pressure could force intestines or other tissues out through the hernia, which would make your hernia more concerning. Good luck!"}

I am not to sure if this allergy is due to the waxing or cuz of the woolen jacket which I wore on d same day....? Any recommendations I am allergic to betnovate ointment..... Is it alrite to use tenovate-m", "output": "Hello Khanpur, It is most likely secondary to procedure, and you must ensure you get a patch test to exclude chemical sensitivities. I presume the allergy was also on the legs. If you had a similar reaction to waxing before, then it is even more important to exclude the chemical sensitivities before you go through another waxing procedure. Allergies to steroid creams are possible and this can also be checked when you have the patch test. For the time being, antihistamine tablets such as cetirizine 10\u00a0mg twice daily or Allegra 180\u00a0mg once daily with Calamine lotion on arms and legs should be enough to control the reaction.

Is there anything i need to be cautios about until surgery?", "output": "Hello Anti, Hope, it is your name. My advice as a Homeopath is not to go for any surgery. There is no guarantee that you will be more comfortable after the surgery on our spine. At least take some time to think very seriously before undergoing surgery. It is a wrong notion that your problem is because of the mechanical alterations in your spine and spinal cord. It can be the other way. You had some problems earlier and that is why your disc material protruded and made compression on nerves. Your two times diffusion was only a mechanical correction. As a Homeopath, I would suggest you to approach an expert Homeopath and get his treatment. Most probably you had a very shocking conflict before the attack of backache and this was repeated in subsequent episodes. They are not resolved. Physical expression is only a subsequent manifestation following the mental problem. Resolve the problems in the mental level by a good counselling and take homeopathic treatment from a good Homeopath. From my experience of 35 years of Homeopathic treatment in a classical manner, I can assure you that it is the mental causes that produce this sort of disc problems, and they can be corrected through Homeopathic treatment after taking into consideration, the mental, physical and general make-ups of the patient. With best wishes for a speedy recovery through Homeopathy and of course without a surgery, Chat Doctor.  C. J. VargheseHomoeopath"}

The pattern is present by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations and contexts. Other symptoms usually include intense fears of abandonment and intense anger and irritability, the reason for which others have difficulty understanding. People with BPD often engage in idealization and devaluation of others, alternating between high positive regard and great disappointment. Self-harm and suicidal behavior are common. Therefore, anger and irritation alone cannot be termed as BPD. This could be stress. We need to find out the origin of the stress and motivate her to either adjust with it or to avoid that circumstance. In any case, she needs the intervention of a counselor or a well-wisher whom she trusts. Let the reality enter inside her mind that her behavior is ruining the future of her own child Chat Doctor.

The injury happened while i was leaning and resting my body over the front of the car, the front part of the car i was leaning/resting on was against my lower abdomen. I was really straining to undo something using my hands and kept going till i felt something like a little balloon getting blown up in my lower abdomen around the groin area. I have been in and out of hospital and seen general surgeons, orthapedic surgeons, nerve and mascular specialists and also physio therapist, theyve found a hernia but said that its small. 2 months ago as it has been going on till now but not as bad, the pain was unbareable, the put in a scope and found that i had alot of adhesions, so they cleared all that up. Now im waiting for a hernia surgery but the pain is extremely sharp and this travels all the way to my left testicle and also makes the vain in the shaft of the penis, the pain gets that bad that those areas can not be touched and takes about 3-4 days to start to become bareable, when the pain is there im unable to put too much pressure on my left leg, walking short distances, sitting on flat and hard seats, sitting in car seats all aggrevate this and make the pain unbareable.

Please help.", "output": "Hi! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Discomfort in the testis could be due to ignored repeated trivial trauma (specially in your case due to your job profile), which causes inflammation causing pain/discomfort in the same. Testis being an intra-abdominal organ embryo-logically, brings the nerve supply to it from above, and so the pain in the testis is frequently radiated/felt as a discomfort in the abdomen/pelvis area. If I were your doctor, after a thorough physical examination I would advise you for the following:1) Support your testes with properly fitting undergarments.2) Avoid standing for prolonged period, and avoid lifting heavy weight if you do.3) Advise you for a routine blood tests like a CBC, AEC, Bag, HIV test and a urine routine/microscopic examination followed by a culture and sensitivity report if need be.4) Avoid indulgence in any sexual activity if you are active sexually which would prevent further trivial trauma if any to the testes, apart from precipitating any kind of infection if present.5) Prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  The antibiotic could change after the report of the culture sensitivity test of urine. Hernia is a separate entity and has to be dealt with separately by your surgeon. However, a ureteric stone has to be ruled out with the help of an abdominal scan which also gives rise to abdominal pain radiating to the penis and testis on that particular side. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

Some time people don't monitor their blood sugar levels and don't even change the medicine and that might lead to malfunction of the medications. Having a keen eye over it will help.  Having pain in the lower back can be due to the weakness of muscles. Using hot water fermentation and doing simple low-intensity core exercises and spinal muscle strengthening exercises will help ease the pain. Do the lower limb exercises as a whole along with the core and back exercise. This will help reduce the back pain and also make the legs stronger.

For this you can start taking methylcobalamin 1500 mcg daily, and it should be continued for at least 15 days continuously. You should also start taking calcium in form of tablets daily and vitD3 60,000 IU once weekly. Kindly mention how many units of insulin you are taking. So far as your chemotherapy is concerned 5 years ago, well it may also cause pain in legs as chemotherapy reduces the potassium in body thereby causing leg cramps. For this I should have asked you to consume banana but since you are a diabetic, so I can't ask that. Start having high protein diet in form of soybeans, you may also consume fenugreek seeds as well. If at all pain worsens then tablet of diclofenac potassium can do your work. But you may consult any endocrinologist for your diabetes and any hematologist to check for your All too. God bless"}

I am runnin 3-4 miles 4 times a week, could the running be causing the back trouble?", "output": "A whole host of problems could be causing the back pain, but running could certainly be one of them. Physiotherapy is essential, and you will need to stretch in the long term.  However, in the short term, you MUST NOT OVERstretch THE PAINED AREAS.  Indeed, a back brace/strap is essential to support you through this acute phase rather than pushing through with excessive therapy. Heat and cool therapy will also be excellent, and I would recommend NSAID medication such as ibuprofen. If you are carrying any injuries in your knees or ankles, or if you have a problem with your instep or gait would also be exacerbated by jogging, and could \"Carr\" your back.  I suffer from this terribly with cycling; which forces me into uncomfortable positions for long periods of time, and also when jogging on my arthritic left knee. Typically, back pain is a muscular pain, and will tend to \"move around\" as different lower back muscles take up the strain at differing times.  A back brace may help with this and enable you to continue to jog. Alternatively you could look into the problems I suggested above."}

Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint in case if there is loss of filling from the tooth and along with it there is sensitivity that is further leading to jaw pain, then it indicates that there is exposure of the nerves that are present in the center of the tooth causing nerve irritation and pain. You need to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and an x-ray has to be taken. In case if there is nerve exposure then root canal treatment of tooth or extraction will be advised depending on the depth of decay in the tooth. As of now you can take anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen t relieve pain, but it is a temporary treatment, and you need to get the tooth treated for permanent resolution as taking painkillers for long durations without doctors advise can be harmful and will however give only temporary relief. So in case of tooth related problems' treatment of the tooth can only give permanent relief. Hope this helps. Regards."}

A thorough clinical Musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you have pain in thigh region, and you feel you have strained your self this could be muscular. As the pain comes in the night, this will be totally fatigue induced pain. As during the daytime the metabolism is pretty active and brain is occupied with end number of thoughts, so pain might not cause trouble. So initially the pain is in the night which will go off on its own in 5-7 days of time if it is related to DOES. Also, if the pain doesn't go in 5-7 days of time and troubles with the change of nature into Radiating, numbness and tingling sensation, a thorough clinical neuromuscular assessment is needed to understand further. Ofcourse when you take medicine than pain will come down as it will work on the pain gate theory and needs some time to see if without medicine pain reduced. Also, later stages performing some regular exercises will help improve the strength in the muscles and avoid recurrent pains.in my clinical practice we recommend such patients to get treated with physical therapy as it will improve the strength in the muscles and avoid future pain and aches.

However, you must remember that a one-off course of antibiotics may not do any harm but if you need antibiotics again, do consult your doctor to see if this is really required. Allergies can feel like a constant flu infection, and testing is recommended. You may already have had tests but skin prick testing or specific IGE blood test for house dust mite, animal dander, molds (alternative, aspergillus, Cladosporium etc.) can be difficult to avoid and treat unless you know that these are also problems. Rhinosinusitis or just rhinitis resolves on long acting antihistamines and nasal steroid spray like alone taken for 6-8weeks. Thanks."}

Fibroids may cause infertility in a number of different ways. Fibroid may cause compression on the fallopian tubes resulting in blockage of the passage of sperm or eggs. If fibroid protrudes into the uterine cavity or causes distortion of the uterine cavity, it may cause mechanical barrier to implantation. Fibroid can be treated by both means conservatively and surgically. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GRH) analogs are commonly used in the medical treatment of fibroid. Mastectomy is the last option, in which fibroid is removes surgically. Hope I have answered your question. Take Care Chat Doctor. "}

This condition arose after delivery. She has symptoms like, she cannot sit long in a same position. Also she has jerky movements. Having fear of loud sounds, vehicles, staying alone and travelling in a crowded public transports. What can we do?", "output": "Hello, Do you mean to say that her condition commenced after SHE was delivered to her mother. OR after she DELIVERED a child?  She may be suffering from back pain preventing her from sitting, and so she could be evaluated for a condition of sciatica or disk bulging that could cause the problem.  Jerky movements should be evaluated by a neurologist specializing in movement disorders and could be related to after effects of anesthetics used (if the delivery was recent) or it could be something entirely coincidental in terms of De Nova movement disorder.  The other issues you mention of the various intolerances to environmental stressors sounds like something that is likely being caused by an inordinate amount of stress upon her.  She may find relief by consulting with someone who can talk to her about what sorts of things are going on in her life including recently giving birth (i.e. postpartum depression) and perhaps some mode of either cognitive behavioral therapy or relaxation therapy with breathing techniques to slow down metabolism, visual imagery, and so forth would be helpful to her.

Upper right abdominal pain along with nausea and vomiting can be also caused by peptic ulcer. Such pain does not radiate to the back (gallstones pain radiates to the back). It starts after a meal. It is usually dull and does not go away after painkillers. Pancreas inflammation can also give similar to gallstones pain. Stone in bile ducts can appear in the same way as well.

The initial management of cervical disc disease is always by conservative management (non-surgical methods) and includes the following -Soft Collar: Soft collar allow the muscles of the neck to rest and limit neck motion. This can help decrease pinching of nerve roots with movement. Soft collars should only be worn for short periods of time, because long-term wear can decrease the strength of neck muscles. Medicines: Analgesic are needed in the acute phase. Muscle relaxants are essential for relieving muscle spasms once the acute pain subsides. Neurotrophic vitamins like METHYLCOBALAMINE (activated It B12) or PREGABALIN will help in alleviating the neuropathic pain. Cervical traction: may enlarge the disc space, permitting the prolapse to subside. Intermittent cervical traction for not more than 30 minutes at a time. Physiotherapy: Once the acute phase of pain has subsided, Isometric strengthening exercises of the paravertebral muscles are started. Improving neck strength and flexibility with simple exercises may lessen discomfort and pain. Moist heat can be usefulEpidural steroids: are useful for patients with severe articular pains in the limbs. Cortisone is a powerful anti-inflammatory preparation and so its injections in the \"epidural space\" can decrease swelling as well as pain.

As we grow older, our follicles reduce and there are a lot of hormonal changes too. A woman of 34 and of 42 are completely different. You should get evaluated for your hormonal profile too with tests like FSH, LH, AMH, Sr. testosterone and estradiol, TSH, T3, T4 and blood sugar and Sr. insulin. I wish you all the best. Chat Doctor.

If it is, then you may need to practice sexual contact on those days to achieve pregnancy. If there is no ovulation with this treatment, you may need some ovulation inducing Chat Doctor.

If it is about ascites, in most cases it does not hurt at all. The only way it can hurt, is when there is so much liquid inside your abdomen, that intestines gets squeezed, and it can lead to intestine blockage. But it would be easily visible, and your abdomen would become unnaturally big, like with big ball inside. Hope this will answer your questions. Regards"}

This is my second reading in one week.  My first reading was 162/90 and the nurse recommended i stop taking some cold medication with decongestion.  I was told to come back in one week to retake.. which i did and the reading was higher, what could be the cause?", "output": "Hello dear, and thanks for posting your query here. The most common cause of high BP is idiopathic, that means where the cause is not known and is mainly related to genetics. This is called Primary Hypertension. It's not curable and needs to be treated to keep the BP under control. Then there are certain other causes of high BP called secondary causes. Many of these are curable. So it is very important for you to see your doctor and get yourself evaluated for these secondary causes of high BP. If a cause is found then it can be treated accordingly. But if no secondary cause is found then you just need to take optimal medicines to keep your BP below 140/90 as per the latest guidelines unless you develop other illnesses. I hope this information would be of help to you. Thanks and all the best."}
{"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "I was told by another doctor - not my own - that it sounded like my asthma was misdiagnosed. When I was 4 I had Bronchitis/pneumonia (not sure exactly which one) and my doctor told my mom and I that all it was was a little infection. But my mom kept on insisting I had asthma, which made the doctor ask me questions that my mom insisted were true although when I was asked them later the answers we always no . I haven t had any problems with my asthma since I was 9- when I sold my cat. I can run 4 miles without an issue, I am never short of breath, I had an inhaler but it never helped or anything; but if a cat gets in my face my eyes get itchy & I feel swollen almost I Have no problems with any other allergies, I am rarely ever sick, and I have no problems nor have I ever that are typically associated with asthma. When I explained this to a doctor I came across while at a restaurant, they said it sounded like I had a cat allergy, not asthma. Would you say I do have asthma or that it s more likely i just have a cat allergy?", "output": "Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Asthma is a very broad diagnosis, it is not a single disease, it has many types. By knowing details about symptoms, it is only possible to judge (judgement vary from doctor to doctor) a diagnosis.2. Diagnosis of asthma can be reliably made by a test known as \"spirometry with post-bronchodilator testing\". So, I would suggest you to discuss need of the test if diagnosis of asthma is a concern.3. From your history, I would think of cat allergy, which can be also confirmed by allergy testing for cat proteins.4. However, I would like to mention here that asthma itself can be manifestation of allergies and one can have asthma due to cat allergy. So, if diagnosis is a concern, both of the above suggested tests will help you so as a consultation with an Allergist-Immunologist. My personal opinion, may be cat allergy, which caused asthmatic symptoms in your childhood but now causing eye symptoms. Hope above information will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."}

Implanon can present with menstrual irregularities. And usually they will get corrected in few months. But as you had excessive bleeding with clots, pain abdomen etc. better to consult gynecologist once and get examined to rule out the possibilities like ectopic pregnancy. You may need one ultrasound. If no abnormality is noted, then the bleeding could be due to hormonal effect only, and you can take additional dose of hormones to control the bleeding.

I understand your concern about the strange things that seem to be happening at home. I know how distressing and difficult it can be if you are feeling constantly concerned and afraid about this.  Lynda, firstly I want you to understand that as doctors, we are here to help you get out of your distress, and I am here to do precisely that by giving you the most appropriate advice. Now, having that in mind, I also want you to understand that sometimes, when we are suffering from a psychological disorder, we may tend to have excessive fears, beliefs or concerns which may actually be a result of the psychological disorder itself.  You have mentioned have been suffering form depression and are on treatment currently. Based on my experience of having seen many patients presenting with similar problems like yours, I feel that these are part of the psychological disorder only. I know and understand very well that to you these things may appear absolutely real, and it may be difficult to accept the fact that these may not be entirely real. But, sometimes, the psychological disorder can influence our minds and cloud our thinking so much that we may end up believing things which may not be entirely real. This can then result in excessive and irrational fears. Now, again, I want you to be very clear that I am in no way trying to say that the distress and suffering that you are going through is unimportant... I fully agree with you that it is very upsetting and difficult. But, it is also important to be aware and open to the fact that your beliefs / fears may be as a result of the psychological problem you are going through... I would strongly suggest getting a review appointment with your psychiatrist. I'm sure he would be able to assess you more in detail and adjust your medication accordingly to control these fears. Wish you all the best. - "}

My pvcs are about 1 per minute. Thank you.", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are diagnosed case of PVC (premature ventricular contraction), we should first rule out cardiac diseases for your chest pain. So better to consult cardiologist and get done blood pressure monitoring, ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Don't worry, you will be alright but first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query.

I have had pressure in my chest. I have a greenfeather filter. Today I went to the emergency room. They did test and stated after testing INR result was 0.97 low. No clots. They upped my coumadin after being on only 2.5 to 5.0. That was Wednesday. MY INR has not raised, I am worried about why it has not raised. I was sent home told to contact my doctor on Monday. Nothing was given to me to raise it. They did cat scan and testing and found nothing including a blood clot. I have been on 2.5 Mg. for a year. I have not had my INR checked until two weeks ago because the doctor I use to have said it was ok for six months to not have it checked. My new primary said that was not correct. Two week s ago I had a blood clot that the filter did catch. Was taken to Freeman Hospital where they did test, and even a echo of my heart, while doing a stress test. They said it was heart burn!!!! My primary said that was ridiculous that it sounded like I had passed a clot that the filter did catch. Never had this close of a call. Today the right side of my tongue swelled for no reason. The emergency doctor said it (the tongue swelling) was probably something due to an allergic reaction. I am not allergic to anything!!! They found nothing sent me home saying to talk to my primary. I am 42 years of age female never smoked, been in great health. Now these items are coming up. I am scared these doctors are not finding what is wrong even with my condition. Why would my right side of my tongue swell during this?", "output": "Hello, I can understand your concern. It seems that the swelling of tongue that you have developed has nothing to do with the DVT and pressure in chest you are having. I agree with your doctor that it seems to be an allergic reaction. I would advise you to take Antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Exocet) or Loratadine 10 mg (Forfeits) once a day for at least 5 days. If it was an allergic reaction, you should find immediate improvement in the swelling in 1-2 days. Otherwise, the cause is not allergic. The allergy could be due to anything that you have been exposed to through air, water or food. If the episodes are frequent, you should go for a blood test for allergy to find out what substance you are allergic to, and you can avoid exposure to that in the future. However, if the swelling does not decrease with the antihistamines or if it increases, then you should consult a dentist to examine the oral cavity and investigate further regarding the cause. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish you feel better soon. Best,"}

In case she seems to be irritable and discomfortable, you can give her acetaminophen or ibuprofen syrup for pain relief. A slightly raised temperature (lower than 38 degrees C), but not a fever can be an associated symptom for which acetaminophen will be helpful. Your toddler may lose his appetite when he's teething.

That removal in a simple Dr. office never had a biopsy. dumb. I know. While working and not wanting to take time off etc. I had this lump grow....assumed it was a giant lipoma. HA! should have done some internet looking back then....but I ve always felt that one way you can convince yourself you have a really weird, morbid disease, is to go looking for trouble. So I finally get this lumped checked out....I first had sonograms of the neck, shoulder areas, thyroid etc. and a chest xray. they take the 3cm mass out. and once I was told it was cancer I went to the local cancer institute here in Cochabamba Bolivia. I have had sonograms of breasts, arm pits. intravaginal....plus regular exams like pap smear etc. The icing on the cake is when I had to get the tomography. of my head, sinuses...and then of the abdomen. no other lumps nor bumps found....(just confirmed that my gall stone hasn t gotten any bigger...that I have some yucky problems with my back bonedegenerating.

That is what the oncologist said Friday when I turned in all my films and lab. oh ya. lab. great lab. no markers out of wack etc. my question....Why would radiation help something that maybe is floating around in all my body at this point....The abcess process was over a year and the lipoma another year nearly. If everything is clear then why go thru the traumatic radiation..... might the diets....vegetarian type, no sugar, chocolate, junk etc be as useful? Will I not have to continue to go in for checkups from time to time with or without the radiation anyway? We do not have insurance here.

This additional dosage may lead to hormone disturbance and hence can delay your next period.

I can understand your situation and problem. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very aggressive cancer of lung. It is very notorious in distal spread and local recurrence. It is highly responding to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But at the same time it again grows very fast. This is the nature of SCLC. And since your husband is taking chemotherapy and developed local site relapse, this suggests chemotherapy is not giving him benefit. So radiotherapy should be started. And no harm in enrolling in clinical trial or consult other oncologist. But at the same time you should be aware of end result. Life expectancy in SCLC is less than 12-15 months.

If the baby is at least a minimum of 650 grams (also depends on various other factors, like lung maturity, developmental assessment of various systems, absence of heart and other gestational developmental problems), the neonatologist may make a judgmental decision, after discussion with the parents, to give assisted care, till baby reaches term. If baby is less than 600 grams, the available medical didactic is not developed to support its survival to term. Hope this helps."}

I am very proud of your lifestyle and dedication to maintain good health. Gout is a common condition that takes place due to high serum uric acid levels.

In my opinion the pelvic pain might be muscular pain. Some non-specific pain appears in pregnancy which subside spontaneously. Take paradox for pain. Induction of labor is indicated when:-1) Pregnancy passing out EDD with no natural onset of labor pains.2)Termination of pregnancy for any reason at term. Before induction the bishops score is taken into consideration where different parameters like cervical consistency, position, dilation,length etc. are taken. If the score is less the success of induction will be less. So I suggest you to consult doctor and get examination done for the evaluation of bishop score. If the score is good induction can be tried. So relax. Hope this helps. Best regards..."}

I would suggest you to get an MRI scan though to rule out anything more serious and then get treated for your wisdom teeth which may need to be removed if it's in an improper position as wisdom tooth can be a cause of discomfort in head and neck which may be making you feel all that you are feeling at present.

Thanks, Susie", "output": "Dear madam, this can be caused by anesthesia. It is not very common complication. The surgical procedure cholecystectomy cannot affect on your tongue on any way. Your tongue was probably pressed up against the breathing tube. Also, some gasses are used during surgery which could affect your taste sensation. The feeling will likely come back over the next few weeks. If there was any nerve damage it will take a bit longer time to resolve.

I ve been put to sleep 23 times since my accident Feb. 2012 for surgery and several injections, blocks, nerve burns....My good arm also hurts worse than my injured shoulder and arm.", "output": "Hi, thank you for providing a brief history of you. Since you mentioned you had severe fracture of the humerus, and it was treated with surgery. The procedure consumed some screws and metal plates. I have to stop here to ask you a question. Were you advised to undergo physical therapy post surgery? As physical therapist will help you regain the shoulder movements and strength in the muscle as well around the shoulder girdle muscles. Coming next to you neck region, since this area was also operated and disc is replaced, were you advised physical therapy even after this surgery?now coming to the current symptoms as to look into. For the pain part the physician has done all the possible ways to help you. He has been perfect to deal with your injury and symptoms. I appreciate it.let's look into how can be more look forward to helping you without any major complications. I recommend you to take an x-ray and figure out the shoulder and neck region bony alignment. Next thing to look forward is to relax the muscle area. For that you can use hot water fermentation as it will provide a vasodilation effect and relaxation to the skeletal muscle. Also to consider is slow stroking massage which will help to soothe the muscle. Now come to the strength part for which you may need to take help from a qualified physiotherapist. The physiotherapist will have the scientific approach towards you. Trying physiotherapy will add on the gradual increase in the strength and which will later on reduce the pain for you.of course for no doubt physiotherapy is a long and time-consuming process, but to be honest is that all the possible way the physician is trying to help you. With the addition of a physiotherapy to your treatment plan will help the medicines work better. Why exercise even in the situation of pain I am advising. Since medicine acts as a supportive therapy for the body, the body even needs the good metabolism and immune system to allow the benefits of medicine to happen. With exercise your metabolism will improve, oxygen carrying capacity of the blood will also improve, which will overall allow the muscle to get the strength and even the medicine will be able to help the symptoms to lower .with the grace of God I further recommend you to do physiotherapy and a good health in the future."}

Or clench my teeth together. I have one tooth that the side is busted off on my left bottom but all my teeth feel like this it happens on and off it will happen and stay for a day or two then go away then come back", "output": "Hi. Thanks for the query. I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that if you have a tooth that is fractured or broken then pain in other teeth on the same side can be a radiating pain from the broken tooth as there must be nerve exposure leading to nerve irritation and inflammation causing pain. Secondly pain on biting down on teeth can be due to generalized gum infection or Periodontitis while jaw joint related problems can also cause such pain. So first you need to get a clinical examination done by an Oral Physician and get a full mouth x-ray known as a Panoramic x-ray or Orthopantomogram done. The tooth that is chipped off will have to be treated with Root Canal Treatment followed by capping of tooth if it is in a position to be saved. For gross decay extraction is advisable. For other teeth treatment will depend on the cause. As of now you can take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen, Naproxen etc. to relieve pain. Take a soft diet and avoid stress as it can cause clenching of teeth that can further cause pain. You can also send me scans of your x-rays by going to my profile and click on \"Ask Me A Question so that we can discuss in detail and I can advise you the most appropriate treatment \"Hope this helps.

If your doctor has examined you clinically and said that the know is due to a misalignment of the spinal vertebrae then most likely it is not a cancer. The spine is made up of many small bones aligned on top of each other. This is further supported by small discs in between any two vertebrae that provides cushioning to the bones. It is best that you get an MRI scan of the concerned region done as a part of evaluation of the problem you are facing. MRI scan will give complete details and there is no ambiguity of the presence of any abnormal tumor or cancer. Any misalignment also requires an MRI scan to be studied in detail. In conclusion, it is best to do an MRI scan of your spine in the region of the knot. This will show the misalignment in vertebrae and if there is any pressure on the spinal cord.

Beyond that, the baby needs a mashed version of adult diet low on spices, introduced step by step. Milk becomes an optional component at this age if other sources of nutrients are included in diet. Cow or buffalo milk has high protein content and hence is difficult for a baby to digest. Most formula milks are cow milk based, and although they are not directly harmful and may be given, but I would prefer homemade semi solids made from boiling rice and pulses along with vegetables and giving it after mashing it. You are doing the right thing by giving Chichi, Reign and pulp of fresh fruits. Most of these would be more nutritive than the available formula, and so I would not speak in favor of formula like NAN or buffalo milk."}

Suddenly getting up from the bed with a feeling of right side of stomach being burnt and then really becoming red and burnt followed by scabbing and peeling may be due to an insect bite. Some insects are so poisonous that this can be caused. In such a case, you need to consult a Physician and get a proper treatment with antihistamine and steroids and excision of the scab, daily Chat Doctor. "}

I read your question and understand your concern. I don't think that there is anything to worry about. In my opinion the problems you have had are related to changes in blood sugar level. You should know that fruits are a resource of slow release glucose. While chocolates and desserts are resource of fast release sugar. So you have a high amount of sugar directly in your blood after a chocolate which causes your body to produce an appropriate high amount of insulin which can overcome the blood sugar level and cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is often associated with fainting sensation. I would recommend avoiding chocolates during your break and try fruits or toast instead. Hope to have been of help! Greetings"}

First let me say that I am a homoeopath, and so I will be sharing with you some different thoughts than what you have been hearing for the last so many years about your sickness. First from the short query, I understand that you had cancer. The word cancer stands for a cellular change occurred in your body some 14 years back. At that time nobody gave you these thoughts and that is why you still hold that what you had was a life-threatening event in your life, and you believe that you are saved from cancer because of the chemo therapy, radium therapy or surgery. As a Homeopath I would say that you had a shocking psychological conflict just before the development of a lump or ulcer in your body and the resolution of the conflict also happened during the course of treatment and so you survived. It was your strong will power or good mentality you developed towards your life situations that you could come back in life. That psychological resolution of your conflict made you to survive but the resection or the cancer treatment did not cure you fully and that is why you are still having pains. Now you are under the impression that there should have painkillers to control these pains. Again take from me that you are getting pains because you are not cured. I really and fully mean YOU. Pain is the language of nature that tells you that everything has not become alright. The body wants a curative treatment, but you are giving Chat Doctor. A child crying violently can be made to shut his mouth by beating him and threatening him with a stick. His cry can also be relieved by giving him stomach full of food or offering what he asks for. What your system demands now is not stronger threats and stronger sticks. YOU need a curative treatment, which so far you did not get. Nobody might have suggested you to undergo a Homeopathic treatment.  Therefore, my advice to you is to approach an expert Homeopathic physician and get the right genetic, constitutional, individualistic and curative treatment. Homeopathic cure is rapid and permanent but in your case I do not expect a sudden relief because for the last 14 years you are under strong chemical suppressive treatment for cancer and other pains. But you will be able to reduce the dosage gradually, and finally you will be able to "}

What would cause this and how do I treat it?", "output": "Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough musculoskeletal assessment with MRI of lumbar spine is advised. Now since you are active and healthy, the injury to the soft tissues to the spine will lead to pinch of the nerve. In the initial stages the symptoms arises are little discomfort in the thighs and legs. But it is always misunderstood as just a muscular pain. But later stages this becomes big and lead to radiating pain in leg. Getting a thorough assessment done and MRI will help understand the pinching of the nerve. In many cases the MRI turns normal but the little touch of the disc to the nerve will alter the sensory pathways and later stages becomes different. Also, undergoing proper physical therapy should help stabilize the spine and these symptoms and the future ones can be controlled.

Reduced physical activity can be on account of your illness (SHE and seizures). When your lifestyle requires less physical activity, then, the food intake should also be proportionately reduced.

It is a common complaint in such cases. Excess heat affects the strength of your hair, causing breaks and burning the roots, making them weak. Even permanent straightening uses harsh chemicals. It could also be due to stress, work, poor diet, other hairstyling products, Dan Chat Doctor. , which have added to the cause. Also, you need to check for other causes like thyroid problems, low iron /hemoglobin, any illness like fever, typhoid, and any long-term medication. Any genetic hair loss, or balding in the family could make you more prone to hair fall. Once the hair roots are damaged or there is hair fall, you will experience this till new strong hair regrows as different hair will fall and grow at different time. This can take a few months. You can check with a dermatologist regarding any tests required to check for these causes, as any underlying cause will affect hair growth. You must firstly avoid heat/chemical treatments as far as possible. Apply warm oil and massage before bath but don't leave it on for more than half hour. At night use Recite or Pressure serum. Wash 2 to 3 times a week/not more. Use a good shampoo like Renoir or Du cray Anaphase. I would advise you to start on a hair supplement capsule like Seraglio Eva or Collinear containing biotin daily for 2 to 3 months to see improvement. Any treatment needs to be taken for a few months regularly to see good results. Be sure to take a nutritious balanced diet and fluids, adequate rest, and avoid stress. Avoid harsh chemicals. You can go in for other cosmetic hair treatments as a later option after consulting dermatologist regarding the necessity, if you see no improvement over a long-term. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."}

The babies special sonography called Doppler studies needs to be done to know the type of blood flow into the placenta. This could be due to your previous history of Pre-eclampsia and HELP, women with these are known to have more likelihood of smaller babies in future pregnancies. Along with regular Doppler and fetal heart rate tracing of the baby, your BP and urine albumin need to be measured as it is likely that you can get pre-eclampsia again. If the Doppler studies indicate abnormal blood flow and ultrasound show that the baby is not growing as expected and the fluid around the baby is getting less, early delivery may have to be considered.

I dont have a history of any kind of stomache problems. Help!", "output": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. The first advice from me to you is to stop eating from outside completely if you do specially the fried, oily and fast food. This might be causing recurrent intestinal infection because of poor cooking hygiene. Apart from the hygiene, some food components specially in the fast food from outside may induce sensitivity to the intestinal mucosa, leading to all your symptoms which you just described. This sensitivity could be due to anything like a lactose sensitivity, and gluten sensitivity, the incidence of these disorders being underestimated in most of the places. Once intestinal infection is excluded, sensitivity to a particular component of the food can be diagnosed by gradual exclusion of that particular component from your diet. This can be well controlled by a qualified dietician and the moment that particular component is excluded, the person start feeling far better.Thus, the treatment varies from one to the other. There has to be a high index of suspicion of these not very uncommon pathology.

All this was following arthroscopic surgery, physical therapy and cocks comb injections which provided no relief. The arthroscopic surgery made the knee even worse. After the second stem cell procedure, the pain tripled in severity and the physician instructed me to take three Motrin three times daily. After no relief in pain, he told me to increase the dosage to six Motrin three times daily, but again no relief. During the adipose tissue harvesting, he had an observer present who later left with some of my stem cells, but without my then knowledge or permission. In addition, I see that lidocaine from Hospira that was used might be part of a lot that was infiltrated during manufacture with metallic particles that could lodge in injection sites or be carried to other sites and cause severe pain, stroke, or other adverse effects. I have been complaining about increasing pain at all injection sites (knee, tibia, sole of foot), but have not had any success with resolving the issue. I did receive notice that Hospira manufactured the Lidocaine, there was no record of the lot number and that the facility did not receive a notice that they were part of a recall. I was a self pay patient and all is far worse following my August 2014 treatment than I was before treatment. The doctor said that he is sorry he couldn t help me and has me talking to a nurse who I have not heard from in two weeks. I recented made an appointment with an orthopedist at a nearby tertiary hospital who spent 8 minutes with me. He asked me to tell him what the problem was, never looked at my knee, took new xrays to the tune of $1100 and then stated that he would not operate on my knee. He told me that he was going to have me see another doctor who specialized in spinal surgery (I have a 22 degree curve that does not cause pain). The office staff was not alerted to this when I asked immediately after and told me that I would be called back. This was over two months ago and I am still waiting. I have a consultation with another doctor in June for evaluation for a TJR, but am now using a cane, walker and almost ready for a wheelchair. Before the last stem cell treatment and prp I still was walking without much pain so my hypothesis is that something in the lidocaine must have initiated the pain since every spot injected hurt and continued to and even resulted in a ruptured quadracepts tendon where injected when he tried to even up my posture. I will be calling Hospira to find out whether the bad lots of lidocaine were purchased by the facility that I had the procedure done at and take it from there. What is your perspective of my situation?", "output": "Hi It seems that you have been suffering badly from pain at multiple sites, which you have correlated to injection sites. One doctor you saw recently has a different opinion, pointing towards spine pathology. You said that injections were given in the knee joint then why tibia or soles be involved. There is a pathology in your backbone causing curvature of spine, possibly Canal stenosis which can explain all your problem. I would suggest you undergo an MRI of your back and NCV of your legs to assess the nerve pressure."}

However, it is advised that it should be used only for short duration. Long term intake can lead to dependence. However, in your case, I won't say that you have become addicted as of now. You're not falling asleep might be because your depression/ anxiety is still persisting. Also, many people develop a psychological dependence that they can't sleep without the sleeping pill. I would suggest that you should discuss regarding this with your psychiatrist. If needed you anti-depressant medications might need a review. It's better to stop sedatives as early as possible to prevent any chance of dependence. Collided has to be tapered when you are trying to stop it. Hope this information was useful. Best wishes."}

It can also happen when the baby is in distress. Since your wife has been advised steroids, it is likely that she is having a threatened preterm labor.

Going by your history, since you are a diabetic and overweight, the body tries to compensate and hence the heart rate increases. Regular exercise can help you bring this heart rate down. It will also help in getting control over diabetes (not totally, you should be on medications also) and also help in decreasing your weight. If it is very high (higher than 120) at rest, you can start taking tab coral an 5 mg twice a day which will help you bring the heart rate under control.

She had a blood test and her spleen was normal but the office said that one panel indicated slightly elevated liver enzymes.  She was on mega doses of tylenol and motrin.  Could that have affected her numbers?", "output": "Hi there, High doses of Tylenol can absolutely cause liver damage. I personally recommend my healthy patients never to exceed 4g (4,000\u00a0mg) of Tylenol per day and not to exceed 800\u00a0mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours.  Anything more can make her liver enzymes increased. I wouldn't worry too much about a slight increase of liver enzymes. If they are continuing to rise, then that could be more worrisome, but a slight elevation shouldn't cause any reason to panic. I usually start to get more worried when AST/ALT are over 200 and continuing to go up.  I'd have her cut back or take a break from the Tylenol for a bit, and see if that helps. I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions."}

And was put on iv antibiotics.  She was diagnosed with C-diff and died a few days later from that.  In her lifetime she did seem to use antibiotics alot for her chronic emphysema and probably the last six months or so complained of diarrhea.  My question is could she have had c-diff before she went into the hospital?  In the past two years she probably lost  30-40 lbs and lost her appetite.  She did eat but got very picky about what she would eat.  Her primary care doctor always did bloodwork on her and it always came back normal.  She also had alot of chest xrays that came out ok.  I was also wondering if she could have had some sort of cancer?  I have gone on numerous websites and could not find how long you can have C-diff and live with it without treatment.  She was also put on 3 liters of o2 the last 6 months of her life since her stats were in the 80s.  I guess I am also wondering about her rapid decline.  she was a heavy smoker all her life but she was so healthy and did alot up until about 2 years ago.  She would not leave the house and seemed very depressed.  She also had been diagnosed schiziophrenia in her 20s and was always on medication for that - she was on prolixim by injection every two weeks for  probably the last 10 or so years and was doing very well.", "output": "Well Hello her, Reading about your mother I understand she had a lot of pre-existing problems which left her body very weak. As her age is not mentioned here, I'm assuming she must be an elderly lady. I'm really sorry for your loss and I know that there may be a thousand questions racing through your mind.  Let's look at them systematically. She was a diagnosed schizophrenic from an early age and on treatment which has its own long term side effects. A necessary evil cos schizophrenia should be treated and it's a long term thing, so side effects could not be avoided. She was a heavy smoker which affected her lungs and heart leading to development of heart failure and COPD which are themselves life-threatening when present as independent entities in any patient. They were both present at the same time in your mothers case. One need not have a cancer. These two themselves are fatal problems leading to rapid decline in one's health. COPD is the condition where the lungs are damaged mostly due to smoking as was in this case and are not able to meet the needs of the body resulting in frequent infections and also cardiac failure. Smoking in itself is a major cause of heart failure as it causes degenerative changes in the heart and blood vessels. Your mother was already suffering from two life-threatening conditions and this along with the C-diff diarrhea proved fatal. Diarrhea in itself if not treated promptly proves fatal. So in this case we are seeing three independently life-threatening conditions coming together unfortunately, proving fatal in the end. So attributing your mothers death only to the C-diff diarrhea would not be appropriate. Hope you got your answers. Take care."}

I also have had a lot of continuous discharge, sometimes clear sometime with a snit kind of colour. I just went to toilet and had a long string of discharge that I ve had to manually get out.

Thank you Lisa", "output": "Hello, Bromine would not be expected to affect a pregnancy test. While it would be unlikely to get pregnant after your procedure, it would not be impossible. However, since you are mostly having negative tests, I would suspect you are not pregnant. If you are, the tests should be more consistently positive as time goes on, so I would check again in a week, and if you are still getting negative then, it would reliably rule out pregnancy.

At ti,es when the discs are bulging they swell out really badly causing extreme pain. degenerative bone disease also runs in my family and for over 6 years, ive been trying to get an mri performed to show everything that is truly wrong with my back.

Hormonal test reports normal and vaginal ultrasound showed normal healthy uterus.so whats the reason of not getting pregnant til now?", "output": "Hi, I guess your concern is not getting pregnant inspire of everything correct. Firstly let us focus on the positive things you have. If sense is normal, hormonal test reports normal, ultrasound report normal, then RELAX, RELAX, RELAX. Everything is normal. You are in safe zone. Secondly I would like to tell that, you have not shared the information about your age and is there any abnormality in your husband. Usually if it is a late marriage there will a problem in getting pregnant. As you not told your age, so it is difficult to comment for me. You have not told whether your husband has got tested. So that adds for double confusion. I would like to focus on the term fertile period, it's a medical term. From the 10th to 16th day of menstrual cycle, the chances of getting pregnant are high. Your ovum gets FERTILIZED BY SPERM AND YOU BECOME PREGNANT, so it is called fertile period. With above discussion try out my suggestions:1. Try to do coitus in the fertile period, remembering the mechanism told above. Usually this solves the problem. You can try this for next 1-2 months. If you don't get a result I suggest you to visit a nearby gynecologist.2. If you are in a hurry, along with above reports visit a nearby infertility specialist. The specialist may tell u to do an extra test- Hysteroslapingography (HSG) for u and may suggest some test for your husband also. So it is wise to take your husband along with you.

Stay away from dust, smoke and air pollution. Try and identify what triggers your symptoms. Keep a pot of boiling water in your room. This humidifies the air and will help relieve your symptoms.

Pacemaker is implanted when the hearts automatic rhythm is too slow. It generates impulses and conducts it to the heart muscle so that the heart contracts effectively and rhythmically. However, it doesn't take care of blockages in the heart of any. Chest pain and discomfort are symptoms of angina which may suggest there are blockages in the heart. Most cardiologists prefer to do an angiogram before pacemaker insertion to see for heart blockages. I don't know if it was done in your case. If an angiogram has been done and there were no blocks then you need not wish about this chest pain. You can take a course of antacids twice daily for 2 weeks.  If there were blockages at that time or the angiogram has not been done earlier, then you must proceed with an angiogram and stenting if required. Also since it have mentioned that pacemaker had to be adjusted several times it is a possibility the pacemaker is pacing the diaphragm.

Usually after giving injection, ovum can get released between 24 and 48 hours. The doctor might have told you to plan intercourse on 13th day because:- Ovulation can occur before injection also, as the follicle reached sufficient size. - Sperms can survive for 48 to 72 hours. So, better to plan the intercourse on 13th to 16th days. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. The possibility of having pregnancy in one follicular study ranges from 25% to 50%.

Should i be worried ?", "output": "Hi, I have gone through your question. I am a practicing anesthesiologist and pain consultant.  You have undergone surgery nearly a month ago, It's very unlikely to have wound infection after such long period.  You don't worry, but at the same time don't neglect it also.

It swelled very badly and i threw up. The swelling is better now but it still really hurts, feels numb in parts, and the skin is peeling. I am 28, female, 5 10 , 150 lbs, history of allergies and asthma , which has been pretty bad every day since the sting.

Bee sting can result in secretion of histamines in our body leading to an allergic response, which can be aggravated if the body is allergic. Pain in finger will subside in due course of time. You can do hot fomentation for relief. If the pain is unbearable, you can take painkiller like Ibuprofen one tablet twice a day after meals along with an antacid. This will also help in reducing the swelling. Taking antihistamines like Fenofexadine 120 mg once a day will help to control the symptoms of your allergy. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."}

This seems to have discoloured her teeth: they appear more yellow. I was wondering if the teeth will return to their original colour. Many thanks, Sharon", "output": "Hello, Discoloration of teeth is not a common side effect for this antibiotic. Tetracycline given before age 8 is a well known antibiotic that can cause yellowing or dark bands to form in the underneath layer of a tooth. Flucloxacillin is not in the same family of antibiotics. If you notice a coating on your daughters teeth, see if this can be removed by proper cleaning. I would suggest a dental exam and dental office cleaning if you are unable to remove the film.  A secondary infection can occur in the mouth leaving a white film on the tongue. The gums will often be sore and red in appearance. This would be oral thrush and can be treated by your dentist. Antibiotic treatment can cause an imbalance of the natural bacteria and an excess of certain bacteria can take over. A change in the color of the gums could make the teeth appear a different color as well.  Are these adult front teeth or still baby teeth that you are concerned about? Are there any other medical concerns or medications being taken? Yellowing of the skin or eyes indicates a complication with the liver that would need to be ad Chat Doctor.  Teeth are made up of tubules with the center pulp containing blood vessels and nerves. This layer is what mainly affects the color of the tooth and could exhibit a transient change. Teeth subject to trauma or root canal can darken from the inside.  Changes to the outer layer of enamel such as calcification, decay and too much fluoride can cause a color change. I am trying to cover some situations that may be possible from your description. I would be happy to answer any additional questions with more details. Having your daughter make a visit to the dentist would give you the best answer and allow necessary treatment."}

Early pregnancy may naturally have periods of episodic vaginal bleeding with clots. This is caused as the baby with the sac in early pregnancy is too small to fill up whole of the uterus. The exposed inner lining of uterus may degenerate and bleed just like a normal menstrual cycle. I am assuming that your ultrasonography after the gush of bleeding showed a live baby with evidence of fetal heart beat. In that case chance of abortion is minimal. ASA or aspirin tablets are given in pregnancy to help in free flow of blood between mother and fetus. Please write back if you have any more queries."}

In some cases the foreskin maybe very tight and adherent to the penis whereby it obstructs free flow of urine, this condition is called Mitosis. In this case circumcision is advice as it may lead to infections. It is advice generally that all uncircumcised males should retract the Foreskin and wash it gently with warm water but not soap as a white Cheesy material called Sega collects between the groove of the penis and foreskin.

I suspect I have neck instability and my family doctor told me that a referral to my local neurologist would do no good because he was not Eds knowledgeable....what type of doctor should I see for CCI/AAI?", "output": "Unfortunately, there is some definite truth to what your doctor says about the lack of specialized knowledge from a neurologist having to do with EDS or the hypermobility factor which is consequent to having the problem.  I'm a neurologist and do have a couple of patients in my HEADACHE CLINIC since these patients will suffer from headaches (both primary types such as migraine or tension as well as mechanical types due to hypermobility issues of the neck because of cervical spine instability from the ED).  EDS is confirmed by genetic testing.  Actually, Kudos to whoever suspected the diagnosis enough from your presentation to send you for confirmation.  The problem with now going to a SPECIALIST for this problem is that there isn't anybody aside from GENETICISTS who may be medical clinicians who would see that many cases during their training in any other field EXCEPT as it relates to the CONSEQUENCES OF the malady.  So, I got to meet these 2 patients whom I've been following (and learning a lot from) because of headaches that were not easily treatable but their primary doctors or other specialists.  Arthropods might have EDS patients due to musculoskeletal issues that may be best handled by them because of ED...but they do not have truly specialized knowledge in the infirmity since it is really considered a RARE GENETIC problem.  Here's a link you can look up if you're not familiar with it to get more information.  I suggest you look up doctors who are on their list of treating physicians since these folks have expressed an interest in treating this problem and therefore, through sheer experience and having an idea of what works and what doesn't work in their patients can guide you or help you get some relief using creative use of prosthetics or knowing who else they might be able to call in case they're not sure what to do next.  Make sense?  First, you may be interested in signing up with a REGISTRY which is GLOBAL and tracks all those who fit the criteria for EDS....check it out...maybe you don't wish to make your information available, but it is a Legit site and has a bona fide mission directed at being able to track and have on hand all folks who fit the registry for future things such as research programs, etc. https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/eds-global-registry/Second, here is the official website for the Ehlers-Danlos Society where you can find a lot more information related to HELPLINES, SUPPORT GROUPS, ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES, CONFERENCES, MEETINGS where both patients and doctors get together and have POW WOW sessions to get on the same page with where the research is, what steps a person can take if they are game to get into a protocol, etc. Send me more questions to www.bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.

As a rule in chest pain, we need to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause. If this is normal than no need to worry much. It is mostly musculoskeletal pain either due to muscular pull or unknown injury. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site."}

This hormone thickens uterine lining making it favorable for implantation of pregnancy. It also supports early pregnancy preventing miscarriage. Rupture of follicles on follicular study after closer 50 use suggests you had ovulation and are likely to conceive if you had timely intercourse. So your doctor has prescribed lupines to support the fertilized egg for implantation and growth. Lupines will not harm your pregnancy or baby in any way. Take care."}

What do you may be the matter?", "output": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns... As per your complaint it seems that your son is suffering from HEPATIC GINGIVOSTOMATITIS which is a viral infection and can lead to fever, swollen gums and outbreaks of blisters in and around the mouth known as cold sores. All the symptoms that you explained are completely pointing towards herpes virus infection. It is a contagious infection and the child may get it from kissing, eating or coming in contact with people who have active infection. The initial treatment is directed towards reducing fever and decreasing the discomfort caused due to inflammation in mouth. You should feed your son with a soft, cold and bland diet, a low spice vegetable soup, flavored gelatin, bread socked in milk etc. can be given. Avoid citrus juices like orange juice and can give him fresh apple juice. For fever, you can give him Tylenol or Acetaminophen . Application of a numbing gel like Lidocaine over the gums and other sore areas of mouth can provide relief, but care should be taken not to involve large areas of mouth as when being numb the child can accidentally bite the tongue and also damage other areas of mouth unknowingly. Doing cool compresses can help. Maintain a good oral hygiene and use an ultra soft toothbrush for brushing can help by preventing trauma and pain to gums. In case if there is an outbreak of sores or blisters antiviral medicines like Acyclovir can be advised by a Pediatrician to reduce the duration of the disease and prevent further outbreaks.

Since it's a shoulder pain this could be related to cardiac origin (associated with difficulty in breathing) though it's not a common presentation.

{"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "Hello. So this is an issue that requires a lot of background info, so here we go. In January of 2013, I had a mysterious and large mass appear on the right side of my neck. There were two parts to the mass, one solid and one filled with pus. No known cause, but whenever I had a needle biopsy done there was nothing coming out of the solid half of the mass so there were never any conclusive results. I had a CT scan done and there was another mass found on the outside of my lungs, but this one was benign. ENT surgically removed the neck-mass and the mass in chest was overlooked due to benign status. So, fast forward to January of 2014, I had to get a follow-up CT scan on the chest mass, and when I got the results a month later I was told that it was now about half the size than it was a year sooner (Good news!). In April, two lumps appeared on the back of my neck, one on the back right side and the other on the back left side. Along with this, there was a bit of swelling on the outer side of my right arm. I was given some antibiotics and sent home. The two lumps on the back of my neck are still there and very solid, but never hurt. The swelling on my right arm has never gone away, and it sometimes has small bursts of pain but nothing to stop me from any regular activity. Finally, recently, there has been some swelling on the left side of my neck, but it isn t similar to the lump I had on the right side of my neck. This swelling seems like soft tissue. Any idea what this may be? During the multiple biopsies and tests the hospital I was with had ran, there were zero signs of tuberculosis and lymphoma. An infectious disease specialist said that it may have been kikuchi disease, but there were no tests to run for it so it was only a theory. I didn t think it would be kiuchi, because I had fit none of the symptoms. If you re able to help, I would truly appreciate it. Thank you.", "output": "Hi, as per your history, Kikuchi-Fujimotos disease is the best possibility in your case and biopsy is the confirmatory test in such cases! Sorry that sometimes all symptoms might not fit due to partial therapy! There is no other specific tests available; However, it could be some acute lympadenitis or toxoplasmosis also! Kikuchis disease just needs NSAIDs group of Chat Doctor. Wish you good health!"}

Bacteria from stool got into babies urethra (in baby girls this often occurs because the anus and urethra are too close, unlike in baby boys), and 2.

Therefore, with the information you provide, I would be more in favor of the first option. Howeve, even in this case I suggest considering the use of an antibiotic based on the type of bacteria detected, the number of bacteria per field and other signs and symptoms of the baby such as fever, discomfort, etc. Also, the hygiene of the baby in that region is important: frequent baths, use of local nutritive and protective creams, and fast change of pampers after stool comes out.

This may happen because of Epilepsy, Syncope attack or some vertigo. But as every blood investigation is normal, BP, ENT and heart is also normal, so possibility of epilepsy is high. Even neurologist has confirmed epileptiform discharges on EEG, so this episode was definitely due to Epilepsy. Repeating EEG may or may not detect epilepsy as it is most useful during episode only. I advise you to visit your neurologist for opinion. As he has asked you to wait for next episode then you can wait. But you have to take precautions as-- Try to avoid bright lights, loud sounds.- Fix your time to sleep, never remain awake late night.- Avoid taking alcohol for now.- Visit your neurologist if problem occurs again Thanks"}

Shona", "output": "Dear Shone, Hair of the body has a natural property of growing. In fact many women get haircut done and still their hair grow regularly. Had hair not grown, the saloons and barbers would have closed down. So do not worry. Whatever your hair cut or shaved will definitely grow back. It may take some time to achieve original length, still they will grow. However, sometimes when completely shaven hair grow, they may change their physical character due to change in the quality of keratin in it. Curly hair may not retain their curliness and may become straight. Now you have to take your informed decision about getting shaved or not. "}

I used a nail scissors and snip of the frenulum 2 times with little bleeding and healed up just fine, why cant doctors do it that way instesd of the z&y cuts they use and stiches, i did not need that at all.", "output": "HI Thanks for posting your query.  Frenulum is a highly vascular structure. It means the blood supply to frenulum is very much. Any intervention over it can cause profuse bleeding.

We did check up @ tata memorial hospital mumbai, they have written in their report that she has heptacellular lives cancer. They removed one tumor kind of thing from her liver & they told us to take her to any doctor & she will be ok.then she was feeling good for two months but suddenly she has started to become thinner. Her liver got swelled thats why her stomach has increased. So now as per tatas instruction we are treating her in one local cancer specialist. Now he says that theres no chance of her survival.Please advise what to do now. Can her liver be transplanted?How much it can cost. Please advise other treatment if theres any. Please give me contact details of some hospitals.", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. I suppose your mother had a hepatocellular cancer in the liver and the doctors at TMH did a liver resection procedure. Liver resection is done for small tumors that can be managed operative. However, cancers of liver might reappear within months. A close watch is to be kept with post-operative screening done for her. It will help to take her to the Tata doctors and get an opinion after doing required testing on the present state of disease. You have written about the liver swelling up. This needs to be evaluated in detail and alternate treatments keeping in mind the survival of the patient must be started. Liver transplant is still in early stages in India, and it is not easy to find a transplant liver and this must be done only if the patient is fit to accept another liver. There are criteria for liver transplantation and cancer patients in advanced stage might not be physically fit to withstand and accept a new liver. The cost is around 20 lakhs rupees and even after surgery there is requirement of lifelong medicine and regular monitoring."}

The only medications I take are 20mg Adderall XR 2x a day, once when I wake up, the other at noon. Around midnight I go to bed and take 2x Benadryl to help me breathe better. Issue #1: For the last 2 years any tiny bit of bending over or walking when theres no airflow in the room causes me to sweat super heavy from my head. I mean heavy heavy. I use my sleave to wipe it off and its soaked. This is really embarrassing at work. Issue #2: I keep waking up with my face swelling up slowly and then all of a sudden I feel like im being choked and for about 2-3 minutes I have to struggle to breathe and then it goes away. I smoke about a half pack a day but I dont think this is smoking related, it feels more like an alergic reaction but the thing is this has been going on every few days or so for awhile now.

This count was taken twice in four days and both times came back zero? Patient was recently diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, platelet count was 32 and 29 when counts were taken at 0 MVP. Also, patient had been off steroids for eight and twelve days, respectively, and taking no other medications.", "output": "Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Mean platelet volume is a measurement of average size of platelets.2. Abnormally low MPV can be seen in thrombocytopenia, as production is impaired.3. In immune destruction of platelets, it will increase due to presence of giant platelets. Absence of giant platelets could indicate better prognosis.4. Repeat test after a week for further evaluation. The present zero MPV is possibly due to non-evaluation by the machine due to thrombocytopenia. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."}
