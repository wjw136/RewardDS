Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity at least 30 min a day and 5 days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any.  Make sure you are receiving antiplatelet like Aspirin clopidogrel, statins like Atorvastatin, beta blockers, ace inhibitor like April and spironolactone, which will prevent further decline of heart function.

The EKG is being compared to last years EKG which didnt show any enlargement.How serious is this at this stage?", "output": "Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I carefully read your query. EKG can detect enlargement of the left ventricle, but not with specificity. Furthermore, there has to be a cause to the enlargement, such as a heart attack. My opinion is that the EKG showed hypertrophy of the left ventricle (thickening of ventricle walls, which mainly happens due to hypertension). Let this aside, this conclusion can be further evaluated with echocardiogram. So, I would recommend you to proceed with an echocardiogram, where it can precisely be seen and evaluated the motility and function of the heart muscle, and the diameter and volume of all heart chambers. Also, valvular apparatus will be evaluated, and a possible valvular cause to this enlargement, if there is one, be sought. There can be also seen if there was a remote or recent heart attack.

Most doctors are no longer recommending surgery to repair blocked tubes. The reason is that the surgery itself is very expensive. And results are not so good. Even if there is a pregnancy, there is a high risk that it will be in the tube. Money is better spent on in-vitro-fertilization. The women undergo fertility treatments to get eggs.

A bone graft in extra site and gtr-resorbable barrier placed. There were 3 sutures placed and I lost one and the collagen barrier is now moving around and away from the extraction site. My dds is on vacation, so how serious is this to the healing process?", "output": "Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The socket healing will take around 7-10days. Nothing to be panic about the membrane. Usually the sutures will resort in weeks to months(if it is absorbable sutures). If it is non-absorbable sutures, then get it removed after 7 days. The problem associated with a mobile membrane is damage to the graft material and delayed wound healing and infection. Do saline gargling and consult an oral physician as early as possible.

She has had 11 radiation treatments of the 18 she was told that she needed. She is having headaches on the right side of her head for the last three to four days, and she started having double-vision yesterday. She was told today that she needed another round of 18 treatments. She is already tired and sick from the treatments, and being disabled, and living with my sister, has been very hard on her. Her calcium levels have been going high lately, but better the last two weeks. What should be done for her? My sister is taking her to her eye doctor Wednesday. Is the treatments causing the headaches and double vision? Should she do the second round of 18 treatments? What do we need to discuss with her doctors and which ones?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. Radiation is a type of energy that is invisible. It is focused high energy on areas affected by cancer and destroys cancer cells. Even after taking precautions, it is possible that radiation therapy might cause short term and long term side effects on the optic pathway. This is the path through which the nerves carry information about our visual surroundings. Headaches and double vision might be related to the lymphoma itself or a side effect of radiation treatment. She should discuss her symptoms with the ophthalmologist and her radiation oncologist to know the probable cause of her symptoms. If it is a side effect on the visual pathway then radiation therapy might have to be planned again such that the side effects are reduced. If it is due to the cancer itself then the treatment might require modification to achieve better response. Please do not worry."}

This is moderately elevated SGPT. It can mean nothing but also can be due to liver disorder. Its elevation is common found in many disorders must most usually is alcoholic, viral, autoimmune or toxic liver damage. The most common liver disorders are fatty liver which can be found in healthy people, but usually is resulting from elevated blood lipids, overweight and elevated blood sugar. If ultrasounds didn't find anything and viral markers are negative then you have no reason to be concerned. You should treat it by changing dietary and lifestyle habits. Do exercise, avoid alcohol, smoking, fats, fast food and carbonated Chat Doctor.  Eat more fruit and vegetables, boiled meat and follow some of hepatoprotective diets.

Last night he said while gargling with warm salt water a peice of what looked like bone and a tonsil stone looking thing came out of his mouth.  He also said he is unable to blow his nose properly.  Since this is Sunday is it okay for him to wait until tomorrow to call the oral surgeon or should he go to the ER", "output": "Greetings to u! I'm glad that I will be able to clear your doubt. There is very less possibility that wisdom tooth removal pain lasts for this long unless it is a traumatic extraction. I would also like to point out that the healing time varies with every person. The gum opening up can be because of vigorous gargling resulting in loss of the healing tissue and bone exposure. But this is very uncommon. Next the bone kind of thing and tonsil kind of thing that popped out could be the healing tissue as I've stated before. All these might have resulted in an opening rather communication between his mouth and nose, the reason for his difficulty in blowing his nose. This can be corrected by a small surgical procedure(if required, which has to be decided by your treating dentist/oral surgeon)Till then avoid vigorous gargling, blowing nose, sucking and sneezing. In case of sneezing please close your mouth and nose with your hands. This is not an emergency situation, so be cool. Hope this helped u. Thank u "}

By your description I think you are having isolated mediastinal lymph node. In old age (your age group) causes for this are1. Benign enlargement2. Infection3. Calcification due to old age4. Rarely malignancy (lymphoma) etc. So in my opinion you should not worry much. As single lymph node is benign mostly. But better to get done repeat CT scan after 6-7 months. If lymph node is decreasing or static than it is benign. And if increase in size than you need to consult pulmonologist and get done bronchoscopic ultrasound guided biopsy of the lymph node."}

My latest tsh was2.0 which is much higher than before and I have gained about 15 lbs in the last year.  Should I be concerned about return of papillary cancer? thank you", "output": "Hello;After total thyroidectomy patient can be placed under TSH suppression or thyroid replacement therapy. TSH suppression therapy involves giving higher dose of thyroxine medication so that TSH level is very low(less than 0.5mU/L). When amount of TSH in your body is low, your thyroid gland stops growing as well as tumor. However, TSH suppression has unwanted effects especially on heart and bone and risk increases as your age increase. Moreover people having low risk disease do not benefit mush from TSH suppression therapy. So your doctor have shifted from suppression to replacement. In this you take lower amount of thyroxine medication, as a replacement of natural thyroid hormone so that your TSH is in normal range. You need to take thyroxine because your thyroid gland was removed. You should visit your doctor periodically and there is no need to worry about TSH level. Regards"}

Next, a physical examination to include blood pressure and then, laboratory testing to make sure you're not suffering from thyroid issues, diabetes, or chemical imbalances of some sort (B12, vitamin D, folate, electrolyte deficiencies).  If an MRI is being scheduled I'm thinking that they are trying to be sure that you do not have any types of tumors, aneurysms, or even congenital intracranial anomalies which by your symptoms doesn't seem to be the case.

We just found out that he has iron deficiency anemia. I also found blood and mucus in his stool again this morning. I am wondering if the blood has been there on and off for this long and it either changed color or I just didnt notice it. What are the causes of blood in stool? Could this cause the iron deficiency anemia? He has been taking iron now for 2 days. What should I do now that I have seen blood again?", "output": "Hi I am Chat Doctor. . Most common cause in a well thriving child is food allergy, that could be cows milk, wheat(gluten), nuts depends on the allergen. Or a bacterial infection (dysentery). But in dysentery kids usually have fever, abdominal pain and vomiting . If child is having constipation causes like rectal ulcer, fissure should be ruled out. There are few serious conditions, but they are so rare . They are uncommon in a well thriving child. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)is one such condition, but I have seen only 1 infant with IBD in past 9yrs of pediatric practice. I can reassure that this could be normal if baby is otherwise doing well. Find out the food and avoid it, it's the best way to diagnose allergy .wait and watch for recurrence of symptoms. Iron deficiency anemia is common in this age group, as mothers milk is not a good source of iron and bodies normal iron stores deplete by the age of 6 months, it is good that u start iron supplements and iron rich food. It is difficult to comment the relationship between iron deficiency and blood in stools. But occult blood loss is definitely a cause of anemia in conditions like nickels diverticulum in a well thriving child. My best advice is avoided allergen, wait and watch, treat anemia. Follow up if symptoms recur or if anemia not improving. Thank you for using Chat Doctor "}

It treated the Acne vulgaris problem well but it gave me other issues to deal with. Such as a pain in the top of the stomach and a pain in the lower back of the head & it feels like in the center of the head too. These two pains come together with the feeling of something moving up through the area where the pain of the back of the head takes place and when this thing moves up it feels like it is dealing with the pain where it makes it go less intense for a moment. Roaccutane also made my depression and fear overcome me which lead me to some kind of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder . I went to see a doctor about the stomach pain and he took tests..(a lot of them) and he told me that my test results have shown no problems but he pointed me to a psychiatrist. all psychiatrists I met have agreed on that I have a depression problem anyway and they decided to treat me for it. the medicine the gave me for it was Seroxat and it has made the case of depression much better. I had it for about about 8 months. Seroxat made both pain in the top of the stomach and the lower back of the head pain less appearing by about 77% because me fearing these two pains has got less power and once they appear this thing that move up in the back of my head which got even stronger after Seroxat makes them go away. (these two pains usually appear when I m stressed out, didn t eat for a while, didn t sleep for a while, change sleeping or eating time habits, After physical exercise).

I guess your concern is about.is pregnancy is positive if is shown 2 dark line in test.right.well my answer is.YES. Congratulations dear.you are pregnant. Let us discuss the pregnancy test. Usually it is done after 5-6 days of missed period. Initially there is T- light pink color, C- dark pink, but it is also taken as positive. With the passage of time T- line will be darker than earlier.in both the conditions it is taken as positive. With the above discussion u can try out my suggestions-1. RELAX.the above test shows that you are pregnant. 2. for more confirmation u can do an ultrasound after 2-3weeks. So things Will be clearer. I hope the above information is useful, informative and helpful for u.regards- Chat Doctor.  Enjoy your motherhood. I pray the God that u will be blessed with a cute n healthy baby)"}
