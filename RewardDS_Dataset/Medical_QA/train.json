{"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "Sir , I am 46 years old and have weight of 69 kg. i have a high ESR rate , test reports showing a high ESR is 57 mm at 1st Hour and all other reports are normal. What is this ESR ? How can i reduce this ESR ? Is this ESR will lead to any other diseases?", "output": "Hello ESR or Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate is normally 2-5 mm in 1st hour. When someone got an infection, it effects on red cells (erythrocyte) and they sediments and this rate is known as ESR, more serious disease(infectious) elevate level. Previously this was a standard parameter for the infectious disease, nowadays most of the doctors call it as irrelevant and don't take it serious. As I mentioned that high ESR means any chronic infectious disease (maybe any e.g. tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, intestinal infection, osteomyelitis etc. This is only example) .ESR high or low don't causes any disease, rather high ESR may be due to some CHRONIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE. So in my opinion consult a physician and get his consultation regarding this as clinical history and physical examination is important. Hope this will help you."}

I was hospitalized for 10 days during which they performed a CT scan, MRI and a PET scan. After being released I was put on 56 days of broad spectrum antibiotics. Another MRI was conducted in June and it was determined the infection had destroyed the disk. A spinal biopsy was performed and it concluded the infection was gone.

I believe based on this physiotherapist will guide you for some treatment (therapy) as well will also suggest a specific exercise therapy.

I cannot for sure correlate your pain with an impending period. The use of an emergency contraceptive pill creates hormone imbalance, hence there can be a delay in the next natural period.

I have a sister in her 40 s who has had a history of kidney stones and has gone through a number of open surgeries for removal of kidney stones which has left one kidney badly scarred that it was not detected on the scan that she just had. She had reoccurrence of kidney stones again 2months ago and her doctor advised for her to get blood transfusion as she had low blood count(?) and she had 3 bags of blood. They also wanted her to go on the dialysis machine which is very expensive in our country where medical facilities are very poor (3rd world country) but we have managed to come up with the money. She was admitted to hospital six weeks ago and was just discharged yesterday without any treatment. They were only giving her painkillers at the hospital. The doctors advised to get alternative treatment to open surgery overseas which is very expensive. I searched the internet and found this all natural product called Renavive and ordered it for her. She only received it yesterday but cannot take this dietary supplementary as she is vomiting everything she is taking into her mouth. Her vomiting started 2 days ago. What is the cause of her vomiting? She still feels pain. PS - she has not been advised by her doctor when she can go on the dialysis machine as it belongs to a private hospital and the public hospital does not have a dialysis machine.", "output": "Hello Maria. As a Urologist, I can fully understand your concern. An ultrasound scan can easily detect scarring of kidneys, due ti infections. A dialysis is advised only when, theres very poor kidney function. A kidney transplant is the other option. Kidney failure causes anemia, for which, blood transfusions(3), were given. It also causes nausea and omitting, as creatinine rises in blood. Block of kidney due to stone, is another cause for the omitting. Renavive isn't advised by Urologists, due lack of scientific study. Maintain low salt, low protein diet, no dairy products, and limited fluids. If you've any other doubts, send it as a direct question, to me. Chat Doctor.  Manga."}

Without more information it is not enough to determine the diagnosis. It could be a hematoma (bleeding in the tissues) or a swollen knee joint capsule. If it's in the back of the knee then it could be a Bakers cyst. Clinical examination (and perhaps fluid aspiration if there's any) would help to determine the diagnosis. Either an orthopedics specialist or your primary care physician can do that.  Until then, you can try to apply ice packs (not directly on the skin - wrap them with a towel) and perhaps use some painkillers starting with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and advancing to NSAID if paracetamol is not enough and there's no contraindication for NSAID.

It is a type of edema, called as dependent edema. If you press at the location of swelling, it will form pit like and then reappears as the fluid fills, so it is also called as pitting edema. This edema is due to back pressure from the heart and occurs at times, when the heart is not able to pump as before due to fatigue. It is a transient phase and heart would recover. If you blood pressure is under control, no other medication is necessary for blood pressure. For edema, in lying down position, limb elevation to above heart level is necessary (use multiple pillows below legs), avoid standing or sitting for few days as it can cause edema.

Many people end up with a second cancer with a history of having been treated for an earlier cancer with radiation therapy. However, at that time, providing radiation therapy had more benefits and risks and has helped in treating the testicular cancer and your husband has been free from symptoms almost 25 years. Plasma cell dysplasia can be seen in such patients but saying with confirmation that it is indeed the radiation that is responsible is difficult. Radiation effects are both dose dependent and non dose dependent. If your husband was exposed to radiation in error at his workplace then things would have been different but in the present case he has been given radiation therapy as a treatment and that has been successful to a certain extent. There are also patients who develop a second cancer that is unrelated to the first cancer. To know the chances of the prior radiation treatment causing the plasma cell dysplasia, all his medical records have to be verified and that will only give a risk. It cannot be said with certainty that the radiation given 25 years back is completely responsible for his present health condition."}

I still havent got my periods and I am feeling pukish and lethargic. is there a chance I am pregnent or is can be a side effect of the pill. I am also having brown discharge everyday since Saturday.", "output": "Hi,First, you cannot get pregnant with an intercourse just before the onset of period as ovulation occurs 14 days before the onset of a period and this is the fertile period which can cause conception. Moreover, emergency pill contains excess hormone and this causes disruption of the normal hormonal milieu of the body. This results in breakthrough bleed, menstrual disturbances and delayed periods. If you do not see a period even 10-14 days after your period is due, you should see a specialist for further help. Hope this helps."}

The last 3 or 4 months my period has been very wierd.  Either very heavy for a day or so or extremely light for around 4 or 5 day.  Ive had two kids and my tubes tied a year and a half ago.

Could I still be pregnant or is it something else?", "output": "Hello, As your both tubes are tied, then possibility of being pregnant is almost nil. There are several reasons of irregular period. This includes ovarian cyst, pelvic infection, hormonal imbalance, stress/ mental upset, uterine fibroid/ polyp, over wt/ rapid loss, irregular diet pattern, thyroid disturbance etc. Here, you need to consult with gynecologist for relevant investigations after clinical examination like pelvic USG scan, hormone assay, thyroid profile, endometrial biopsy following D & C, blood sugar & prolactin level etc. Proper treatment depends on etiology. Take healthy diet with iron supplements, control body wt, maintain genital hygiene. All the best."}

The first time occured in 2007 and I took Prednisone for 6 months. The counts remained normal for 3 years and recently I had a re-episode of ITP. Within 3 days of hospitalisation and Prednisone (Methyl) given thru glucose transfusion the count came to Normal.

Please advice", "output": "Hi Ratio, ITP, especially in adults can have a chronic course, sometimes persistent, and a recurring course with varying frequencies in others. The steroids have to slowly tapered and stopped, and later you have regularly monitored your platelet count to watch for recurrence. However, don't get paranoid and a platelet count more than 30,000 is compatible with a normal, albeit disciplined lifestyle as long as your bleeding symptoms are in control."}

I want a hysterectomy because for the past year I have dealt with my periods being so heavy I have to sit on toilet", "output": "Hello, thanks for using Chat Doctor. Ca 125 as you already know is a marker for cancer. It increases in cancers of the digestive system and those of the reproductive system including the ovaries, fallopian tubes, endometrium of uterus etc. It is highly used in the diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer. Ca 125 is not specific to a particular disease and does not necessarily indicate a malignant disease. It could be elevated in benign conditions such as uterine fibroid as well. From your history; heavy menses, anemia, enlarged uterus etc., there is a good chance that what you have is a uterine fibroid. The only problem is that the ca 125 level is far above the normal which is 35 (300 in your case). The appearance of uterine fibroid on ultrasound is particular, and you should see your ultrasonographer to say if the mass was not well round and with borders and characteristic of fibroid. If it's a fibroid or none metastasized cancer, hysterectomy will be just fine. Best regards and hope this helps. Chat Doctor. "}

Thanks in advance, doctor.", "output": "Degree understand your concerns went through your description. I suggest you not to worry much. You are just 14, and you started worrying about so many things. That is the problem. When we worry, we become anxious. Anxiety produces so many uneasy feelings in the body and pain in different parts of the body is common. Pain in the stomach area is most common, and you are victim to that. Instead of worrying about what you have not, concentrate on your education and career. Masturbation is common and natural and every man do it. Even animals masturbate. Masturbation twice a day is also normal in your age. When you grow, your priority changes to education and career, and you start spending your energy towards more useful work. You might need psychological counseling., I am more than happy to provide telephone psychological counseling through Chat Doctor. Contact me through customer care, www.ChatDoctor .com. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck."}

I found out this evening that she is back in ICU. It s my understanding that her heartbeats that should be @ 100 drops to 50 and that they plan to shock her heart tomorrow! Is this normal procedure? Safe? and what does it all mean is going on? Thank you Bev I apologize, I am not financially able to pay for this service. Thanks anyway", "output": "Hi, According to the scenario you are telling I am expecting she has an irregular heart rate called as AF - Atrial Fibrillation which causes decreased cardiac output and is bad for patients especially those having a valve disease. If she does not have a clot in her heart, and it is a new episode, we generally prefer to convert it into normal regular sinus rhythm which is done in two ways - medically or by giving a small intensity of shock. Giving shock is more effective. So I think this is what your doctors must be doing. I expect that was helpful to you and don't worry that shock is given when patient is sedated so she won't feel anything. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."}

In throat infection the child probably needs antibiotic like amoxyclav for 3 days and a cough syrup.

It doesn t hurt when I press on the outside of my chest. It s definitely internal.", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should first rule out cardiac cause for your chest tightness. So get done ECG. If ECG is normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause. Your chest tightness can be due to anxiety mostly. Anxiety can also cause HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). And this can also cause chest tightness due to acid reflux. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Avoid hot and spicy food, start proton pump inhibitor (for HERD). Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent acid reflux.Don't worry much, you will be alright."}

Secondary bone cancer in a female is mostly from breast, lung, kidney or thyroid. Pelvic tumors spreading to bone is rare. The pelvic tumor may itself be a secondary. She needs CT scan thorax and abdomen, mammography and thyroid ultrasound to locate the primary. A few special tests (immune) on the biopsy can also tell something about possible primary.

He didn t ejaculate anything but I didn t get my periods yet am worried am pregnant. Having menstrual cramps for past 3 days. Is it a sign of pregnancy and I don t want to get pregnant again . Wat can I do to get my periods at this stage to avoid pregnancy. Pls help with ur suggestion.", "output": "Hallow Dear, During lactational phase, though the periods have started, they may be irregular and so is the egg release. Hence, you cannot rely on safe period. Even though he did not ejaculate in the vagina, usually pre-ejaculation secretions (pre-cum) does get deposited in vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum contains some sperms in it which can cause pregnancy. I would not give importance to the menstrual cramps. Maybe you might get menses in few days. To determine the possibility of pregnancy, the best and quickest option for you is to opt for Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood 10 days after the incidence of unprotected sex. Alternatively you may wait for 21 days after unprotected sex and perform pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample; earlier this test may report false negative results.  If you are not pregnant, you can take some progesterone preparation like Devilry for 5 days or Estrogen + Progesterone combination like EP Forte for 2 days. 4-7 days later you will get with Chat Doctor.  If you are pregnant, you can terminate the pregnancy by medicines up to 9 weeks of gestation.

Did my semen analysis about 6 months back and it was normal as per the report. I do masturbate every day, could that be the reason. Can you please help me with a way out since am feeling that am not able to satisfy her and sacred a lot.", "output": "Dear service user, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern about loss of erection before vaginal ejaculation and also for having child. Loss of established erection is commonly caused by performance anxiety. Occasional failure can occur to almost every man in his life. When this happens, one gets concerned about performance during next sexual encounter. He thinks whether he would be able to satisfy the partner or not. So, his mind thinks mostly about quality of erection and performance. For constant erection continuous exciting/romantic/erotic feelings should be there in mind. If mind is diverted to concern about erection (being scared in your case), you will lose erection. This in turn reduces your confidence, and it again affects the erection. Having erection during masturbation indicates that your organs are functioning absolutely normally. Masturbation is a healthy part of sexual activity, and it does not cause impotency or infertility. There are effective behavior therapies having strong research evidence for psychogenic erectile dysfunction. You can read about Senate focus on internet. I suggest having consultation with psychiatrist. There are medications like verapamil or tadalafil which can be helpful with behavior therapy. It is good to listen that your semen analysis report is normal. As far as pregnancy is concerned, you may consult infertility specialist for same. There are treatment options like artificial insemination which can be useful for you. Wish you good health."}

I have really bad teeth, that a little at a time I have been getting pulled out due to costs. I had an infection for the better part of 4 or 5 months but it didnt abcess until recently. I could just feel a huge puss pocket.  I finally got it pulled after being on 4 rounds of antibiotics on the 18th. It is a top back molar on my left side. The dentist informed me that the infection had completely eaten away the whole bone leaving my sinuses or sinus cavity exposed. Ever since then I have not been able to breathe out of my left nostril. I have been having pain since then in my jawbone on that side. Each day it gets worse but its spreading. Now its right in the front of my ear a little above, in my ear, behind my ear and then wraps around the back of my head. The pain just gets worse each day. The dentist told me it shouldnt be hurting and he doesnt know what it is. I do not have medical insurance as well, so Im tryin to avoid hefty ER bills if I dont need to go. Im just concerned this could be something more serious. Do you have any idea what this could be or what I should do? Thank you, Jennifer Duffy", "output": "Dear Patient, I can understand your concern and feel sorry for the pain you are suffering from. You are informing me that when you got the upper molar extracted, the dentist told you that the bone between the sinus and tooth is destroyed and sinus cavity is open. Roots of upper molar often are found inside the maxillary sinus, which causes opening of the sinus cavity while extraction of the tooth, creating an oro-antral fistula, that is a direct connection between oral cavity and sinus cavity. In this case, the food or water you take has chances of passing infection in the sinus through mouth and the infection does not resolve. It is mandatory to close this connection between mouth and the sinus. It could be done by the dentist by taking stitches in the area when he found that sinus has opened, but it can also be done now. However, as about 2 weeks has passed since extraction, the opening would not be as much clear as it would have been during extraction. A blood clot may have filled the area. So what you need to do now is, go to an oral surgeon or an ENT specialist. I know you have insurance problem, but there seems no other solution to your problem. You might have to go for x-rays and probably CT Scan of the area to diagnose if oro-antral fistula actually exists and if it does, you might have to go for a little surgery to close the communication between mouth and sinus followed by antibiotics to resolve the infection.

This can be pressure sore but since he is running temperature of 100.5 then probability of perianal abscess is also there.in that case, such swelling should be evaluated by the doc via clinical examination so that he should further guide your husband about treatment plan which can be either via Conservative approach or via surgical approach depending upon the size and condition of the lump as well as the condition of the patient, Hope this may help you.

{"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "HI, For the last one month, I have been experiencing tiredness, sleepyness, dizzy and pain in the temple area. Got my tests done and my doc says that this is due to the rise in insulin and has advised me to avoid sugar or sugary food at all. Before the test he had given me some multivitamins but in vain, post test diagnosis, he has given me some medicine to control the insulin level I believe. However, its been a week now and I dont see improvement. I am worried. Please help and suggest which doc (specialist) i should consult for this issue. Regards Rajesh", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is possible that you have higher than insulin levels circulating in your blood. This is causing the blood glucose levels to go below normal and that can cause problems like tiredness or dizziness. This if confirmed might be the opposite of diabetes where the insulin does not act on receptors. You should consult a doctor who deals with conditions of pancreas. They can be gastroenterologists or endocrinologists. They have to do certain tests to know the source of high insulin and few tests like insulin levels in blood and ultrasound and CT scan might be asked for. There are small tumors called insulinomas in the pancreas which secrete excess insulin and a search for such tumors is indicated. Insulin is a benign tumor of the pancreas in 90 percent of patients and removal of the tumor cures the patient of the symptoms. Please do not worry."}

While headache and dizziness are common symptoms associated with high blood pressure, transitory sight loss is a potential serious concern. If that happens again (but you should be sure it is a loss of vision, not blurring) you should consider transitory ischemic attack, and you should seek emergent medical care. You should not be worried, but concerned. Hope this helps. Wish you the best health."}

Occasional dry mouth at night doesnt help.

Can you advise? Thanks", "output": "Hi and thank you for choosing Chat Doctor to post your health concern. I read carefully your question and my opinion is as follows:From what you describe it seems to me that all these paroxysms of intense coughing lasting up to several minutes, the tendency to vomit after cough(possessive vomiting) and the duration of cough(4\u00a0weeks) match with the clinical presentation of pertussis infection. I don't know about your vaccination status (incomplete or absent pertussis vaccination)Pertussis is a respiratory infection that lasts about six weeks, starting with a catarrh phase followed by a paroxysmal phase and convalescent phase. Vaccinated adults usually develop only prolonged bronchitis. Treatment usually involves an antibiotic, but it only helps if administered in the first or second week of symptoms. In your situation Ventolin inhaler that your doctor prescribed helps to reduce the paroxysms and would help also if you start antitussives such as dextrometorphan, codeine.another less possibility of your health problems is even the beginning of an asthma since very frequently it can be precipitated from a viral infection. It would help me to support this if I would have a well given medical history(allergies, familiar history of asthma)and physical examination Spirometry is useful for diagnosis and the treatment need to be guided by its value.

I would like to have more information on the nature of the lesion found in your MRI. You should know that there are different sequences in MRI exam, which can orientate towards the nature of the lesion (white matter gloss, inflammation, vascular or tumor). Your symptoms don't seem to be related to a lesion on the frontal lobe. Numbness in both hands is not caused by any lesion in this region of the brain. The spasms of your neck muscles too. I recommend you to perform a cervical spine x-ray and routine blood test for inflammation, which could be related to this clinical scenario.

Please type your query here...I have a sharp white bit of skin under my tongue on the middle of my glands that hurts when i touch it, ive got an infection in my saliva glands so i dont know if its normal when you have a gland infection to get this?", "output": "Hi. Thanks for the query. A sharp tiny bit under the tongue in the middle of gland seems to be a salivary gland stone or a smallish that might have formed in the duct of the salivary gland, and it can even more common to occur after salivary gland infection. I would suggest you to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations like cross-sectional x-ray or MRI of the salivary gland can help in diagnosis and treatment can be planned accordingly... As of now you can apply numbing gel over it in case of pain. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and in case if it is a stone the physician can try to remove it by pushing it manually towards the duct orifice. If it is not removed manually a small incision/ cut can be given under local anesthesia over the stone and removed. Hope this helps. Regards."}

In early stage if life expectancy is more (like more than 10 years or 5 years depending on additional criteria) radical treatment is offered.

It has been a week since my diagnosis and I am still in bed from the pain and nausea . I read that this condition can actually lead to an acute appendicitis if not treated properly. My appendix showed no swelling and my white count was 0. Do I have a reason for concern ? Thank you. Bonnie C.", "output": "Hi Bonnie. Thanks for your query. It was wonderful to know that it took 3 months for a diagnosis of Mesenteric Lymphadenitis. This is a condition in which the multiple lymph nodes in the mesentery get enlarged. The commonest cause is always secondary to some infection or cancer. I think you are less investigated than required as you are still in bed with pain and nausea. I would advise you the following:-Consult a General Surgeon.-Get further investigations to see if there is any other problem related to blood cancer or so. You're writing of white count of 0 is not acceptable, this is either your you ignorance or something else you could not note.-You need a Diagnostic Laparoscopy and Biopsy of the lymph nodes for the proper diagnosis. This allows to see all the interior of the stomach and appendix and other parts of the intestine and pelvic contents. Can tackle any problem hence seen. -A course of broad spectrum antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines. I hope this answer will help you to get to the root-cause and proper treatment."}

Is the use of this medicine(steroid) effect him in long run? what are the diagnosis which can be done, as his general physician says he has Childhood Asthma.", "output": "Hello, thanks for posting on Chat Doctor, I understand that this must be a very troubling situation for your. But what you need to understand is that the underlying causes of childhood asthma are not fully understood by the medical community. Developing an overly sensitive immune system generally plays a role. Some factors thought to be involved include:- Genetic inheritance- Certain childhood respiratory tract infection in early childhood- A child who is exposed to certain extreme environmental factors such as cigarette smoking.  Increased immune system sensitivity causes the lungs and airways to swell and produce mucus when exposed to certain triggers. Reaction to a trigger may be delayed, making it more difficult to identify the trigger. These triggers vary from child to child and can include:- Viral infections such as the common cold-Exposure to air pollutants, such as tobacco smoke-Allergies to dust mites, pet dander, pollen or mold-Physical activity-Weather changes or cold sometimes, asthma symptoms occur with no apparent triggers. As child will get matured, his lungs will become much more mature and the frequency of crisis will be less but that does not mean that the asthma has been dissolved. You will need to know that asthma is a chronic condition and only requires child being on regular treatment. I do not think that being on low dose corticosteroid will not be of any harm to your child and other medications (such as bronchodilators) will be used instead to replace the steroid.

This has happened in the past and my doctor prescribed an antibiotic to help with the infection so it didnt spread.  What antibiotic will help with this that I could call into my doctor for?", "output": "Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint cold sores are caused by viral infection, and it is a HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 1. The virus can remain dormant within the nerves and can get re-activated at any point of time and can cause an outburst. The severity of the symptoms depend upon the severity with which the infection has occurred, and it is not always necessary to have mild or severe symptoms and can vary at every outburst and in cases when there is some reduced immunity of the body the infection can occur with higher severity. As the antibiotics acts only against bacteria so taking an antibiotic for viral infection can no way cure the infection. Swollen lip and submental lymphadenopathy or swelling can be due to infection outbreak only. I would suggest you to consult an Infectious disease specialist or a dermatologist and get evaluated. You will be prescribed with oral anti viral like Acyclovir and Acyclovir for preventing further outbursts. Although the antivirals do not cure the current infection, but it prevents the further outbreaks of the infection. Applying Rivera which is a topical antiviral ointment can help and should be continued. Avoid making intimate contact wit other individuals as it can cause them infection as well as use personal things like towels, utensils etc. without sharing with others to prevent transmission of infection as it is a communicable disease.

After couple of weeks of thorough tongue washing and dental hygiene, it is still there. May be a coincidence but I ate 8 boxes!! of altoids over a period of 2 weeks prior to noticing this spot. I used to crunch alotids on the left side primarily (because i was suffering from tooth ache on the right side). I got crown done on a tooth to the right side of my mouth around the same time frame. My dentist looked at it and thought it was just pigmentation but not sure why it would develop all of a sudden. My doctor did a blood test and found me slightly anemic (didnt find any cancer). He put me on iron tablets but primarily because he thought my 2 week altoid craving was result of pica (i think). I have taken couple of cipro 500mg few weeks before noticing the spot just to get rid of cold. This may have killed good bacteria, so I started taking probiotics (bayer truebiotic).  All of this happened in a period of 1-2 months.  I am giving all these details because I am not sure (and neither are my dentist and MD) as to which of those may have caused these black spots to appear. My MD mentioned that after taking iron tablets for couple of months, if it still doesnt go away, i should see an ENT specialist.", "output": "Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There are several reasons that can cause black spots on the tongue. Practically without inspecting visually it is almost impossible to predict the correct diagnosis. A good picture may also help. But most common black spot on tongue which is of a pea size along with similar spot around it could be suggestive of \"black hairy tongue\". It is simply the elongated growth of the papillae present over the tongue and discolored by food stain and bacterial growth. Sometimes the elongation is so much that it looks like a bunch of hair over the tongue, hence its name. It is generally caused by some illness, some medicine intake and mostly due to some local constant irritation. Interestingly intake or using mouth wash containing MENTHOL for long time is one of the local factor of developing such condition. Which could happen in your case as you were taking Altoids (peppermint/menthol) for long time with one side. Doctor prescribed iron tablets because iron deficiency is also sometimes blamed for this kind of condition. Antibiotics generally does not cause this condition until taken for long time at a stretch.  Anyway, the condition is self limiting but may take time to regress. Continue your iron tablet, stop Altoids. Maintain your oral hygiene with proper brushing. Keep your tongue clean gently using a tongue scraper or using your tooth brush. Do not use any commercial mouthwash, warm salt water mouth wash can be used instead. Hope your problem will be relieved soon. Good luck."}

{"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "I have been trying to get pregnant since the last 5 months but everything in vain. Met a gynecologist and she suggested ultrasound follicular study.But when ultrasound scan was done the dominant follicle was 26 mm on 17th day and so my doc was worried. Another ultrasound on 26th day showed ovulation had occured. But inbetween this cycle we had relations. And the next cycle actually wasdelayed by some 5 days which had never previously occured in my case. But unfortunately I got my periods some 5 days later.(As I get my periods regularly and get it exactly on the 29th or 30th day). But during that time i was really stressed and had a heavey workload.Does that mean may be i was about to concieve but something happend? Can you explain this? All the tests including TSH,FSH,Hb,Fasting sugar,prolactin and LH have been done and all the results are very normal. Only that the follicle doesnt ovulate in the normal size. So doctor advised for induced ovulation in the next cycle and i started taking fertylfrom the 5th day of my cycle and continued till the 9th day. When an ultra sound was done on the 12th day, it revealed 2 big follicles one 33mm and the other 27 mm. The 33 mm one she categorised as cyst, but she told me to do an ultra sound the very next day to make sure if ovulation will occur or if the induced ovulation injection can be given.The next day the cyst measuring 33 mm had increased to 38 mm but ther was not much of a change in the 27 mm  follicle. So doctor advised me not to take the injection as it looked like some hyper-activity. And wait for another 2 cycles till this subsides. I am worriedbecause of this cyst formation due to the induced ovulution drug that she administered. Will it be a serious problem in future? And is the cyst size of 27mm too large or ripe to even ovulate? should I get into some other medication, or wait and try for another 3 months?", "output": "Hi, the cysts is not much of a problem.  They resolve in 2 to 3 months. But I think in your case it is better to start the ultrasound from 2nd day of your periods.  It will tell exactly regarding the status of your follicles.  You can monitor your cycles every 2 to 3 days.  Don't take any medicines.  When follicles size reaches 18 to 20 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  It will make sure your follicles rupture at a normal size.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor. "}

I would suggest you to apply a moisturizing lotion over the rash, especially immediately after bathing to retain moisture within the skin. 3. I would suggest you to take an antihistamine like HY Chat Doctor. 4. Please do not scratch the itchy areas as scratching would aggravate itching.5. Please avoid exposure to sun while you have rash because some rashes in SHE can be sensitive to sunlight. You could apply sunscreen (SPF 15 minimum) and wear full covering clothes to protect from sunlight.6. If swimming aggravates itching and rash, please avoid swimming as long as you have rash.

Anyone who has unprotected sex is at risk for pregnancy. However, many women can also experience irregular cycles and hormonal imbalances after discontinuing Depo-Provera. Some women do not resume normal monthly cycles or ovulation for even up to year. So it can be difficult to rule out pregnancy if you have irregular cycles after taking Depo-Provera. Unfortunately, pregnancy related symptoms can vary widely between women and actually most women do not have any symptoms of pregnancy at all before a missed menstrual period. Furthermore, many women experience psychological symptoms of pregnancy due to unconscious fears or desires. So I would suggest that you do a urine pregnancy test, so that you know for sure what is going on. If you do not desire pregnancy, I would suggest that you select an alternative method of contraception because even if women do not get periods regularly they still can be at risk for pregnancy. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes, "}

What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastronomic reflux. It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the baby takes milk, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastronomic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health."}

The most of them are viral. You say you have stomach ache and mucous maiden stools in your description. Have you cramps, or watery stools too? It seems you are having a gastrointestinal infection and in your case it's probably a bacterial one. So to manage that antibiotics are needed. I would recommend you the same antibiotic you are already taking, Ciprofloxacin twice daily for at least 7 days. Meanwhile, you can keep the high temperature under control with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Always try to take these pills after meals and with plenty of water because your stomach is very sensible now. Have a balanced and light diet, with liquids and watery foods. At the same time I would recommend you lactic ferments to prevent the side effects of the antibiotic and arrange the bacterial flora in your intestine. I hope this answer was helpful to you!

A month ago I slipped and fell down my steps and I landed on my back on a step. It hurt extremely bad, but shortly after, the pain went away so I thought I was fine. But as the days passed, my back started hurting more and more. Now, it hurts to turn around to look behind me, pick up things, lean forward and it really hurts when I lay down and try to get back up. I know I should have probably went to the hospital. I just figured the pain would disappear. Unfortunately, the pain hasn t gone away. Any suggestions?", "output": "Hello Stephanie, Thank you for your post. You are probably having a vertebral column injury or spinal cord injury or just post-traumatic pain (due to pressure on your back muscles and subsequent inflammation). Spinal cord injury is most unlikely because if you have, you should have started developing nervous deficits on your upper or lower extremities depending on level of the lesion on your spinal cord. Cord compression due to vertebral column displacement is another possibility but as I said developing neurological deficits would have been showing as symptoms except of course the injury is very, very mild and also pain will not be the most likely symptom. Vertebral column injury will simply be a small fractured bone of a vertebrae or displacement/dislocation which would present as a pain of progressive intensity as you continue daily activity. The other option is you are having back muscles contusion that should disappear with use of analgesics like as acetaminophen or Tramadol or anti-inflammatory like diclofenac or ibuprofen either orally or local pomade with massaging. In either case, you will probably need to visit a radiologist to run a CT scan or X-ray of the vertebral column to rule out any serious abnormally. Hope this helps"}

Sometimes the evaluation of pelvic pain is in an effort to answer the question \"is it GUN related pain or not\".

She is completely on breast feed, & has gained only 100gms wt in 15 days.", "output": "Welcome to the ChatDoctorI understand your concerns. If you're breastfeeding, green poo can be a sign that your baby is taking in too much lactose (the natural sugar found in milk). This can happen if she often feeds, but doesn't get the rich milk at the end of the feed to fill her up. Also, it leads to poor weight gain. Make sure your baby finishes feeding from one breast before you offer her your other one. Too much lactose in feeds can lead to reducing substance positivity in stool examination. If pus cells in stool are less than 5, its normal. If you are breastfeeding your baby, she is less likely to suffer from diarrhea. This is because your milk helps to prevent the growth of the bacteria that cause it. In my opinion, you should follow these measures:1. Breastfeed regularly. Let her finish from breast before you offer from the other breast.2. Start her on probiotic such as enterogermina once daily. If she has fever or her stools have pus cells more than 5 and the stool consistency and color continues to worry you, you may contact me."}

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to give you my opinion. Supraydin in a multivitamin capsule. It mainly contains vitamin A, E,D. It doesn't have elements that can interfere with your existing blood pressure treatments. But you should take this kind of multivitamins if you are diagnosed to have deficit of this vitamins like it D, E, deficit in minerals like Magnesium etc. So, the main think to discus in your case is to explore the reason why you feel weak. Taking tree medication like tenor min, norvasc and aspirin is not a reason to feel weak. Only if you have very low blood pressure below 100/70 mmHg and frequencies under 50 beats for minute the medications might be the reason, and you have to lower they're dosage. But if you have normal blood pressure, normal frequencies and normal heart function it's not the medication fault. So, if I was your treating doctor I will ask a fool blood analyze with your minerals, electrolytes your thyroid hormones and a cardiac echo to better understand the cause of your weakness. If you have normal mineral and vitamin levels it has no sense taking capsule supplements. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards."}

What test should I have done, I have had a Stress test, Heart Imaging test, and electrocardiogram two months ago, and they turned out to be normal. Should I be concerned about the doctors findings on the heart murmur.", "output": "A lot of the answers you have received are correct. Albuterol speeds your heart up, So you should be on a preventive medication to keep your asthma under control. A heart murmur can be caused by many things. Has your doctor referred you to a heart specialist or is he doing these tests on his own. I have had the tests that you have mentioned. They showed nothing of my heart condition. The less invasive tests are an echocardiogram and now there is talk that an MRI can also show what is going on with your heart. The symptoms you mentioned could be a sign of something serious. I am not trying to scare you. You do need to see a specialist if he doesn't do more tests, and you continue to have the same symptoms. Go to an ER next time and let them admit you and run the tests. The next step after the tests I mentioned would be a heart cauterization, you will be put in twilit sleep while they perform that procedure. That test is usually the last one they perform, but they get a better picture of what is wrong with your heart or if you have a blockage, mitral valve prolapse or mitral regurgitation which is what I was finally diagnosed with.

Is there any other cause other than diabetes? I have been googling & getting seriously worried! Help?", "output": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. As per your complaint acetone smelling breath occurs when there is excess ketone production in body due to breakdown of fat. It gives the breath a typical fruity/acetone smell and can be seen in cases of illness like viral and other infections. Another most common cause for acetone breath can be Diabetic Ketoacidosis. In case if your child is smelling ketone like breath even in the absence of any illness then it can be an alarming sign of Juvenile Diabetes and you need to consult a Pediatrician and get him evaluated and a thorough clinical examination and investigations like blood test can help in diagnosis and will be treated as per diagnosis.

Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns.

As gold and plastic are inert materials they do not cause this reaction... I would suggest you to gently remove the earrings and clean the airholes with Betadine [provide iodine] solution and try to discharge pus as much as possible. After cleaning properly apply Triple Antibiotic Ointment over it. Repeat it at least twice a day. If it improves in 3 to 4 days its fine otherwise consult a physician, and he can advise you oral intake of antibiotics. Once the healing takes place it will be better to avoid wearing metallic earrings and wear only gold earrings and plastic if you wish to. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

I take 20mgs oxycontin twice a day & 5mgs oxynorm 3 times a day, this used to help slightly but recently it has stopped easing the pain. I also have two lumps on my lower back(episacral lipomas i think they may be called) which are very painful. My back pain is worse from sitting for long periods, driving and being on my feet for long periods. Lying down and resting only eases the pain slightly. The pain often radiates down my buttocks and into my legs. Please do you have any idea on either of my problems? Im at my wits endThankyou", "output": "Hello. Thanks for writing to us. From your description, it seems that you are having degenerative disc disease affecting the lumbosacral spine causing lower back pain radiating to legs. The swellings in the neck could be swollen lymph nodes and need to be confirmed after examination. Bed rest is the mainstay of treatment. MRI will help in detecting the cause of pain in base of skull. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you."}

According to you your son is excellent in academics and can focus on all activities, can communicate very well and is highly analytical. That is certainly good for a 4-year-old child. I don't see anything wrong in the behavior of the child. At the age of 4, any child is supposed to be a bit hyper mainly because of the playful attitude. You may search internet for the signs and symptoms of hyperactivity and compare with your child. It's natural to wonder if ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) could be the cause of your children high energy. But just being hyper doesn't necessarily mean your child has the condition. Watch out for these other signs of ADHD:Does he interrupt frequently? Does he have trouble following instructions and organizing tasks? Is he forgetful? Is he impatient? Does he frequently speak out of turn? If your child has ADHD, these problems will happen over a long period of time, and usually at home as well as school.

From the given symptoms it is almost evident that you are suffering from social anxiety disorder or social phobia. Social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is an anxiety disorder in which a person has an excessive and unreasonable fear of social situations. Anxiety (intense nervousness) and self-consciousness arise from a fear of being closely watched, judged, and criticized by others. A person with social anxiety disorder is afraid that he or she will make mistakes, look bad, and be embarrassed or humiliated in front of others. The fear may be made worse by a lack of social skills or experience in social situations. The anxiety can build into a panic attack. As a result of the fear, the person endures certain social situations in extreme distress or may avoid them altogether. In addition, people with social anxiety disorder often suffer \"anticipatory\" anxiety -- the fear of a situation before it even happens -- for days or weeks before the event. In many cases, the person is aware that the fear is unreasonable, yet is unable to overcome it. For social anxiety disorder, the most effective treatment currently available is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Medication may also be used to help ease the symptoms of social anxiety disorder so that CBT is more effective. Please consult a psychiatrist / psychologist.

But still not getting sleep. Can i know take zolpidem also as i am restless now? Also please suggest the long term treatment to my insomnia? Thanks Ashraf", "output": "As a neurologist (non-sleep specialist) I do not believe that prescribing medication in such situations ahead of specific testing and assessment of a person medical/biological/psychological status is the best approach and in my experience it rarely yields positive long term results.  I would ask the doctor to refer you to a neurologist with experience in sleep medicine in order to do a good thorough workup.  Your weight alone is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea which is a strong risk factor toward insomnia.  What if that were the problem?  Or at least 1 of the problems?  Secondly, I would get a set of laboratory studies to rule out other potential issues that could lead to your not being able to get to sleep or stay asleep.  These things I would do ahead of any medication which has already proven not to be the ultimate solution.

From you history of pain on the right side of abdomen specially after food accompanied by bloating sensation, the diagnosis goes more in favor of gall stones with infection of the gall bladder (Cholecystitis). Whenever there is intro abdominal infection, there will be pain which may be severe on movement due to inflammation of the local parietal peritoneum. That is why you have got pain on movements. Apart from the cholecystitis, there are a few other conditions which can give rise to similar symptoms, but I do not want to confuse you by just telling you the names. If I had been your doctor, I would first examine your abdomen followed by investigations like CBC, Blood sugar, LFT, S Amylase and Lipase, followed by an ultrasound abdomen to confirm my diagnosis. In such a provisional diagnosis of cholecystitis, you should avoid fatty food which may aggravate your pain, and you can go for an anti-spasmodic for an immediate relief. But you have to consult a general surgeon to diagnose the condition by physical examination and investigations for further management. Thank you for using Chat Doctor forum for your health query.

Psoriasis is characterized by the presence of well-defined, thick scaly plaques mainly involving the scalp, and extensor surfaces like elbow, knee, lower back etc. The disease has a chronic course and the course is fluctuated by remissions and relapses, however there is no permanent cure for psoriasis. Specific topical treatment options for psoriasis plaques consists of ointments containing potent steroid with or without salicylic acid. These are available in ointment form for plaques involving the body and as lotions/gels/foam form for scalp psoriasis. Topical vitamin D analogues like calcitriol, calcipotriene etc. are also effective for localized plaque psoriasis. Besides specific remedies for psoriasis, moisturizers form an important part in the management of psoriasis because of the thick scaly nature of the plaques. Moisturisers enhance the penetration of topical active ingredients as well as prevents or delays side effects like skin atrophy etc. Unlike extensive psoriasis disease for which both oral and topical treatment is required, for limited disease topical treatment alone is effective.

I carefully read you question, and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something. There are different reasons that might cause increased heart beats. Simple physical or emotional stress, caffeine products might cause increased heart frequency so It's mandatory to avoid them. After eating, our metabolism increases, so it might be normal to have slight high frequencies for a while. Or it may be another problem. When you eat, the abdominal distention rises up the diaphragm and in a secondary way might trigger the heart for higher frequencies. A simple gastro-ezofageal reflux or the food that comes back from stomach to esophagus all saw might be the cause. There are different pathologies like anemia, thyroid gland problems like hyperthyroidism that might be the cause of fast heart beats. When you experience a high frequency, it might be normal to experience palpitation, chest discomfort, pressure and breathing difficulties. So, if I was your treating doctor, as you allays connect these symptoms with eating I will recommend a gastroenterologist consult, a fibrous-gastroscopi maybe to exclude any problem like re-flux, diaphragmatic hernia etc. After this I will recommend an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echocardiography and of course a rhythm holder monitoring for 24 h. This is necessary to have a full view of your mean frequencies during day and night. After these, a full blood check up to exclude anemia or thyroid problems as you want to have a baby soon. Doing these examinations helps us understand if it is necessary to treat this high frequencies or not. You should not be worried, because this is nothing serious. Hope I was helpful.

I am starting to have slurred speech and now my younger sister is starting to get the same symptoms just out of the blue. It gives me an empty feeling not knowing what can become of my life. I am a positive person but I truly need to know more information on this disease to satisfy myself and my sister. If you will give us some answers on this matter we would be so greatful. We do have doctors but they never gave any info on this subject to really learn more about it. We are both the type to put it straight in our mind that what is happening is what it is and we take it day by day. We are easy going and just want to evaluate what is in store for our future years. Preparing our mind for what is coming is important for us and our families. If you could give us some insight on this rare disease it would be of great help to us for setting our minds up in the future. Just in four years time I have really seen a big change in my body and walking and speech. I will be anxious to recieve your reply. Thanks for helping me.

He told me I some peridontal issues and I need to have four of my teelth removed. 1 has a chronic infection from a root canal. I thought I was just going for a cleaning as my teeth dont hurt and my gums dont bleed. Why would I take out teeth that dont hurt? Thank you.", "output": "Hello! Thank you for posting here. Periodontal infection can be mild bleeding to mobile teeth. Periodontally infected teeth can be saved to an extent if they are moderately effected. When the infection is more severe(it shows as mobile teeth, gums going down) it is best to remove the teeth. You did not mention if you are a diabetic. Periodontal infection can lead to microorganisms(infection) spreading to the rest of your blood. This also has a compromised chewing ability. Your doctor will assess your periodontal status based on clinical examination. I suggest you to go for the treatment plan suggested by him. However, ask him if a flap surgery can help you save these teeth(a clinical assessment is necessary)A chronically infected root canal led tooth is a failure. You can get it retreated if it is periodontal sound. Control your blood sugar levels and maintain a good oral hygiene routine to prevent other teeth from being affected. Hope this helps."}

I have been using African black soap for my face and it works wonders to help keep my skin nice. I was also using the cream tenovate plus to treat occurrences of acne on my face. I thought the cream worked so well that I began to mix it with my daily moisturizer and apply it to my face every morning. I have been doing this for at least 1-2 years now. Well, the store that I bought tenovate from stopped selling it so I no longer use tenovate. Not too long after I stopped using the cream my face broke out severely and my skin darkened and it is really itchy. It has been 2 weeks and my skin has not improved. I just recently read online that tenovate is bad for your skin and now I am scared I have damaged my face. What should I use to help restore my beautiful face?", "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor Yes, indeed renovate should not be used on face, in fact using it on face and that too for acne is an absolute NO for me! It contains a potent steroid, clobetasol propionate which can cause steroid related side effects like Acne, photosensitivity, hirsutism, skin thinning, telangiectasis etc. I would suggest that you use a topical broad spectrum sunscreen throughout the day, that which offers both UV B and UV A protection, till your skin returns to normal, which might take a few days. An OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10\u00a0mg once daily would help you symptomatically with the itch. If I was the treating doctor I would have started you on oral antibiotics for acne e.g. either doxycycline or azithromycin, would be good for acne flare. Topically you could use clindamycin phosphate 1% gel twice daily over active acne. Use a gentle cleanser for face wash e.g. detail cleansing lotion, twice daily. Regards"}

I think that you should get evaluated for the position of the IUD in the current scenario. Displacement of the IUD can often lead to the symptoms you are experiencing. Another possibility is an ectopic pregnancy that could be pressing on the bowels and bladder. A sonogram of the pelvis should be taken to confirm/exclude pregnancy. If the IUD cannot be located, MRI or CT scan of the pelvis is needed to locate the device and plan further management. Infections and other local causes also have to excluded, though less likely in this situation. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."}

The problem with brain death is that almost every feature that is supposed to be in favor of brain death can also be caused by another cause. So no one single sign can be confirmatory of brain death. Besides, seizures also happen due to more than one cause. There may be a structural brain lesion, there may be a severe infection (sepsis), there may be serve metabolic derangement (again of many types). And once a seizure happens, the patient may become unresponsive for a long period of time, say even up to 72 hours. The physical signs can in fact mimic brain damage.

As per your complaint it seems that blackish or grayish discoloration on the tongue of 9-month-old is most commonly due to poor oral hygiene maintenance that leads to abundant deposits of food debris and also bacteria and fungal overgrowth over the tongue leading to formation of a dark coating over the tongue. It is a condition called Black Hairy Tongue. It is however harmless and can be gradually removed if proper oral hygiene and cleaning of tongue is done. You should start cleaning her tongue using a soft toothbrush. Give her solid foods to eat. Use a tongue scraper to gently clean her tongue. Feed with plenty of water.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that these high blood pressure values could be related to different causes: 1- thyroid hormone imbalance. As you are taking levothyroxine, it would be necessary check your thyroid hormone levels to regulate the dose of levothyroxine.2- Other secondary causes of high blood pressure should be excluded. That is why I would recommend performing some other blood tests : - complete blood count for anemia-liver and kidney function tests for possible dysfunction- fasting glucose for diabetes-blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). 3- If all the above-mentioned tests result normal, primary hypertension should be taken into consideration. In such case, you should discuss with your doctor on the possibility of starting antihypertensive therapy.

Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that pacemaker implantation is required when something wrong is going with heart stimulating impulses generation or their conduction through special underlying cardiac conductance system as well. There are several cardiac disorders which deserve such a therapy, in order to supply inadequate cardiac impulses, avoid consequent daily physical performance limitations, and furthermore treat life-threatening conditions. Each cardiac disorder needs a certain pacing (and hence pacemaker type) regimen, one-chamber, dual-chamber, etc., and different pacing regimens, like AAI, VRI(R), DDD(R), etc. It is important to identify the exact primary cardiac disorder, to optimally define the appropriate pacemaker device. So, if you could supply a resting ECG, or an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG recording (if the disorder is transient), it would be possible to clarify this issue. Regarding pacemaker costs, it depends on health insurance policies, available and applied to your living area, county, state, etc. and to certain individuals. There are no strict rules. Privately costs in my region, differ from type of pacemaker, and medical center (approximately 2500 - 4500 euro). Hope to have been helpful to you! Greetings! "}

Masturbation is a safe way of expressing ones own sexual desires. It leads to know physical or mental problems. The sperms and semen which are formed in the body are meant to come out of the body.

A fast pulse rate can have many causes. To name a few common ones: anxiety, emotional stress, panic attacks, exercise, fever. You mentioned that you were not feeling well.

My due date was March 7th 2015 but when I went to get an ultrasound on August 11th my doctor told me my due date was now March 11th 2015 and I conceived between June 13-15th. So who is the father? I believe I got pregnant on July 18th because of my first due date on March 11th. I just think my baby is growing fast so therefore the CRL measurements of my baby made the doctor change my due date to March 7th.", "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Unfortunately, ultrasound findings of the dating the pregnancy can be off for up to five days. So the changing of your due date by four days does not really change the possibility of your first partner having been the father of your baby. Furthermore, sperm can remain alive in your genital tract for up to five days, and once you ovulate, the egg remains alive inside you for up to 72 hours. This is the reason that no test can accurately assess the date of conception based on the exact dates that you had intercourse.  Women typically ovulate two weeks before their period arrives.  If you have a 28-day cycle, and your last period started on June 4, you likely ovulated around June 18.

Could the fact that I was grinding and fidgeting with them made it possible for the inner skin inside to peel off inside of my body as I have had feelings of string or rubber wrapping around my head and body sometimes it feels like my ear is actually pinned backwards but when I look I m the mirror it is fine. I went to the doctor and he said it was neurological so I went to the emergency room and get MRI and am awaitiny appointment with him. Have you ever heard of anything like this?", "output": "Hi. Thanks for the query. Well, if you have a habit of grinding teeth then the denture will unfortunately not set well causing difficulty in adaptation of the dentures. It can continuously dislodge he denture and making it difficult for you to wear them and use efficiently.However, the denture will not cause any peeling of skin inside body or the other symptoms of string wrapped around the head. Yes, you are advised correctly that the symptoms can be neurological and even the grinding of teeth can be related to it. So my suggestion is to get your MRI evaluated.Also, for teeth grinding habit you can do meditation and reduce stress. Also consult a Prosthodontist for manipulation of your denture. Hope this helps.

So you may be having some type of reaction to the hormone fluctuations. I suggest you speak with your healthcare provider and try switching to a lower dose pill and also one that is the same hormone dose all month, called monophasic.

Took her to ER, had chest xray, ekg, bloodwork--all showing normal results.  Echocardiogram was suggested by ER  but primary dr felt it would show anything since other tests were normal.  There has not been any unusual stress excecess caffeine or any other issues causing stress.  I am very concerned.  Could this be a blockage or infection of the heart or possibly a lung issue causing the heart problems?", "output": "Hello thanks for posting here. Going by what you described primarily looks like a panic attack. EKG is not required at this point of time. Once an anxiety factor is ruled out, and if she has similar complaints again then an EKG would be advisable l. another possibility is that she has got arrhythmias which means irregular fast heart beats. These can lead to palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue etc. A blockage in the heart arteries seem unlikely in view of her young age. This may be due to some electric impulse conduction problems in the heart which can lead to fast heart beats. . Also get her thyroid function tests done because thyroid abnormalities can cause palpitations and shortness of breath. Wishing you good health"}

Thanks :))", "output": "Hello. Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor Since you seem to have a generalized involvement with psoriasis; this type of involvement is also known as erythrodermic psoriasis Or unstable psoriasis. This type of psoriasis involvement is associated with thermoregulatory as well as metabolic complications as a result of the lack of normal temperature regulatory functions of the skin as well as loss of proteins, and fluids from the skin. In general unstable forms of psoriasis like erythrodermic, pustular psoriasis is managed conservatively with topical emollients and Oral / Systemic Immunosuppressive like Methotrexate, Cyclosporin etc. Before starting on PVA, patients skin is tested for the tolerable effective dose of PVA, known as MED (minimal erythema dose). The starting dose of PVA is then calculated as 75% of MED. However, if all the skin is already red, there cannot be an accurate determination of MED. Therefore, if inadvertent higher doses of PVA are given in erythrodermic psoriasis without calculating MED, PVA can further irritate the skin and therefore is not the first choice amongst dermatologist in unstable psoriasis. Nevertheless, PVA can be given in low doses along with other systemic treatment like methotrexate, cyclosporin etc. even in erythrodermic psoriasis. Regards"}

I have gone through your complaint and can very well understand your concern. As per your complaint you are suffering from PERITONITIS which is inflammation of the gum flap that covers the wisdom tooth, and it gets swollen and painful either due to infection due to food deposition between the gum flap and the tooth or if the flap gets bitten by the opposite arch tooth. This can lead to severe pain, swelling on cheek and at times can cause difficulty in opening mouth and even swollen lymph nodes under the jaw. It is the most probable cause of the symptoms you explained, and you need to consult a dentist and get evaluated. In case of Peritonitis you should do warm saline gargles and a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500\u00a0mg thrice a day for infection, Advil twice daily for pain, Pantoprazole 40 mg one tablet empty stomach to prevent stomach upset by antibiotics for 5 days. If the condition does not resolve or there are relapses you should get the gum flap surgically removed under local anesthesia.

I was a smoker for many years and I quit three months ago. I am looking for a doctor that can recommend a solution for a heart patient.", "output": "Hello thanks for posting at Chat Doctor. Burning sensation in the legs can be caused by peripheral neuropathy which means pain or burning sensation due to damage to nerves of the legs. In smokers the arteries of the legs below the knee tend to develop plaques causing pain on walking and burning sensation. To evaluate that you have to do a bilateral lower limb arterial Doppler. If this condition is found you can be started on medications for the same. Second thing that can cause this is long-standing diabetes. Now you have not mentioned if you are diabetic or not. I recommend getting a fasting and post radial blood sugars and an HbA1c test to confirm the same. You can take tablet pregabalin 75 mg at night for the pain. But important is to get evaluated for it. Wishing you good health. Regards"}

He was suffering from fever and cold and have a small swelling in the neck region.Doctor prescribed CLAVUM 375  one tablet thrice in a day. After followed his advised my son become ill and huge rash was followed in his body. my question is was this advise was good or not", "output": "Although most of the fevers are due to viral causes, often antibiotics are given to control super added infections if any. CAVAM contains amoxicillin+clavulinic acid both of which are safe to be given to a child. A dose of 375 mg is ok to be given to a child of 17 kg, and you need not worry about that. In some cases like infectious mononucleosis, a viral condition, dose of amoxicillin may give rise to rashes. Although the doctor had given it in good judgement, the antibiotic needs to be discontinued and the rashes would soon improve on its own. You may apply some emollient/moisturizer in the meantime. You may also give levocetirizine 5 mg tablet once daily for 3-4 days."}

Have you tested your blood for that? Facial hair growth has gone to do something with testosterone levels but It's not completely due to it. I have seen many men with less facial hair and still have baby. Also, chest hair growth is not always due to testosterone. If you aren't obese, hit the gym. Else also do exercise daily, because this will boost up your self-confidence and also testosterone. And girls like guys who present themselves well with confidence. Looks become secondary for many.

What should be the preferred frequency of dialysis. 2.Whether dialysis can be termed as good ao bad based on some criteria. 3.What should be the levels of creatinine and urea just after dialysis. 4. How much reduction in creatinine and urea is expacted in single attempt of dialysis. 5. What are the chances of reduction of frequecny of dialysis for such patient. 6.WHether some other treatment ( Ayurvedic, Homeopathic etc) shouldbe taken along with Allopathy. 7. Whether this diseases can be cured in allopathy.", "output": "As per history the condition is presumed to be End stage renal disease with Diabetic Nephropathy on Biweekly dialysis. Chronic renal failure (CRF) requiring dialysis or transplantation is known as end-stage renal disease (ESD). 1) The preferred frequency of dialysis depends on the blood urea and creatinine levels. If the Glomerular Filtration Rate falls to less than ~20% of normal, symptoms of uremia may begin to occur. They almost are invariably present when the GFR decreases to less than 10% of normal. If these values are on a higher range, dialysis frequency may be more. If its moderate then the frequency reduces. 2). Since dialysis does what is supposed to be done by kidneys(an essential organ for disposing waste), it is more a good than seeing bad in it. 3) As it is the problem of CRF the levels can't come to normal or subnormal, maximum reduction in creatinine and blood urea levels should be tried at each session without interrupting the comfort of the patient. 4) The reduction of creatinine and urea after dialysis depends on the pre dialysis creatinine and urea levels, the nephrologist takes the final decision on this, even if the values are on a higher range.5) Allopatry medicine never recommends ayurvedic and homeopathic treatment. 6) The disease cant be cured as it's damage to both kidneys, kidney transplantation is the other option. The problems are age of the patient, availability of donors to donate kidney, the transplantation surgery after that, complications of transplanted kidney. To summarize, Dialysis is the longer, the better, the slower, the better, more often the better, the gentler, the better. Let me give few good medical tips regarding diet for CRF patients on dialysis. Dieticians consult is crucial.a) The diet should maintain a balance of electrolytes, minerals, and fluid in patients who are on dialysis. b) Diet includes high in protein and low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. c) Fluid intake is also restricted\u2019d) Before dialysis, you may be asked to limit protein to slow the progression of kidney disease. At the start of dialysis, you will need much more protein. Many patients need to take vitamin supplements. e) Diet alone can usually meet the requirements for the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Vitamin D may be supplemented, depending on your calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels."}

I have had trouble breathing for a couple of years and it continues to get worse.  Lately I feel very bloated after eating or drinking just a small amount and worsening acid reflux.  An upper GI showed no GERD.  A barium x-ray showed some reflux.  I am currently on Warfarin.  Today I was told that the CT scan also showed a hepatic hemangioma. It is possible that the Hepatic Hemangioma is pressing on my lungs (causing shortness of breath) and on my stomach (causing the fullness and bloating)?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No, hepatic hematoma is unlikely to press lung and stomach and cause symptoms. Hepatic hematoma is actually accidental finding in most of the time, and it is asymptomatic. Rarely large hematoma can cause pressure symptoms. So if the size of your hematoma is less than 5 cm than it is unlikely to cause these symptoms. In my opinion, Pulmonary embolism and warfarin are causing all these symptoms. Pulmonary embolism causes restrictive lung disease and this is the likely cause for your shortness of breath. Warfarin is known to cause severe gastritis and bloating. So hematoma is unlikely cause.

I first want to reassure you that women can and do have healthy pregnancies with thyroid disease all the time. In the case of someone like you, whose thyroid has been essentially destroyed by RAI, your TSH will frequently be high. But as long as your free T4 is normal (which is the actual level of your circulating thyroid hormone) the baby will receive enough hormone for normal healthy development. So as long as your supplemental thyroid medication is at the correct level, your baby will be fine.  It is more important to monitor your thyroid hormone level by the T4 value, however, rather than the TSH. Your endocrinologist likely will check your level every month or two during the pregnancy as most women need more thyroid hormone as the away grows. So in summary, there is nothing to be concerned about right now, and under the right care you should absolutely be able to have a healthy pregnancy. I hope this answer was helpful and reassuring.

Cancer is a difficult condition and curability depends on the response to treatment. Sometimes one or more treatment methods have to be implemented to make sure that there is better survival.

I have had a disc-ectomy with fusion in 2012 and in Feb of 2013 reinjured my neck in an auto accident. I, in the past greatly benefited from Oxycodone 10mg, It totally worked for me. Other medications such as Nambumetone, Naproxen, Cyclobenziprine, Amitriptyline, Prednisone, as well as several others were not effective. I am an electrician and I do a lot of tasks that are posture compromising. I am often required to crane my neck for extended periods, ( a recent pain management Dr did not know what craning of the neck meant) I have to access crawl spaces and attics. I have to manually bend conduit, and work overhead. I have to work above suspended ceilings off of a ladder, outstretching and reaching to pass wires along, By days end I am in agony. I am unable to get my current primary care physician to prescribe the one medication that works for me. Oxycodone.. I am aware of the dependency risks. I am also aware of some of the warnings that come with the medications they are so freely willing to give me. Shouldn t the decision be mine as to which risks I am willing to take. Nambumetone for example has risks of gastric bleeding, increased incidence of stroke and a slew of other possible side effects. The Amitriptyline has been shied away from for years as an anti depressant because of far safer forms of antidepressants currently available, yet they are more than willing to let me take it for neuropathic pain, even-though it is ineffective. How does one approach a physician about prescribing Oxycodone, without appearing as someone seeking it for less than honest reasons? I genuinely benefit from the 10 mg dose. It worked wonders the 8 months I was on it. it worked so well I opted not to have the additional fusion surgery recommended after my 2/10/13 accident.. When I opted out of having the 2nd fusion surgery the surgeon subsequently ceased prescribing the oxycodone & told me to get it from my PCP who is unwilling to prescribe it, and now I am once again contemplating having the surgery. I actually had the most productive 8 months in over 5 years while taking Oxycodone. My pain was managed, my pain associated depression was non existent, I functioned at work, and got things done at home after a day at work. Now I just barely make it through the day, and when I get home I am a couch potato, to sore to do anything. .

First, what can a nephrologist do to help my 87 year old mother with an unexplained low sodium problem? Her GP wants her to see one and the appointment is set for next Tuesday. I understand that a nephrologist deals with acute kidney problems which has not been a problem for my mother. And second, is there any reason why I can t use salt tablets to help keep the sodium up until we see this doctor? Previously, my mother s GP and neurologist have looked at the medicines she s taking to no avail. Her neurologist has said that the low sodium led to a few of her seizures. My mother is a heart patient with an irregular heart beat. She had a pacemaker put in several years ago and had surgery to put in a stint in 2001. In addition to this, she s a Type II diabetic, has significant arthritis in her shoulders, knees, and hands, and - in the past 2 years- has had 4 seizures with 2 prior seizures that were misdiagnosed as TIAs by her former doctor. She has frequent headaches in the area where the seizures have a occurred. The medicine she takes is as follows: Omeprazole DR- 1 tab (40 mg) taken - AM Digoxin- 1/2 of a 250 mcg tab taken - AM Isosorbide DN- 10 mg 2x per day Metoprolol Tartrate- 1/2 of a 25 mg tab 2x per day Pradaxa - 150 mg tab 2x per day Levetiracetem (Keppra) - 750 mg 2x per day Loperamide (Immodium over-the-counter) - 250 mg as needed for diaahrea I ve been able to keep her blood sugar down but she has sudden bouts of diaahrea, which we know can cause sodium and dehydration problems. We had a renal panel done yesterday and the results came back today saying her sodium was down to 128. She has seizures at 126. I wanted to give her sodium tablets but her GP said not to do that until she sees the nephrologist. In the meantime her GP knows that I am concerned that she will have another seizure.

Following measures would be helpful:1. Physiotherapy- back extension exercises, pain relief measures such as IT/Ultrasound/traction, etc. I have seen many people get well with them. 2. Avoid forward bending and lifting heavy weights. 3. I would agree with you that repeat surgery may not work, and hence you should not go for it at this stage. Also, second surgery is technically more difficult. 4. Some people get relief with neuropathic pain medications, such as pregabalin. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. "}

I want to know how safe this after birth and is there any harm of this extrarenal pelvis. Please give me detailed information regarding extrarenal pelvis in kidney of fetus.", "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. An extrarenal pelvis is a variation of the anatomy of the kidneys which is actually found in about 10% of the population. It is absolutely no long-term medical consequences, but it can be confused with other types of urinary obstruction which do not have as good a prognosis therefore it is always important to monitor it if it is seen in a fetus to make sure it is not another more dangerous diagnosis like urinary obstruction. So there are no consequences of the babies health by having an extrarenal pelvis. Many people who have this condition are not diagnosed until they have a test such as an ultrasound of the kidney or CAT scan for another reason and have never had any symptoms over the course of their lifetime. So there's no reason to worry further about the health of your baby because of the extrarenal pelvis. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. Best wishes to you and your wife for the rest of the pregnancy,"}

At times, she also forgets things (doctor says mild hepatic encephalotpathy). What is the life expectancy of such a patient if her liver function tests show retrn to normalcy through some ayurvedic medicines?", "output": "Hi, Often the complication of liver cirrhosis is hepatic encephalopathy. It is due to biochemical abnormalities associated with liver failure. Hepatic encephalopathy [HE]is marked by an intractable cycle of relapse and remission, followed almost inevitably by relapse. Episodes of acute encephalopathy can be reversed; however, people with chronic liver disease are consistently susceptible to future relapse. If your grandmother is taking some ayurvedic medicine [I can not comment much as I am allopathic doctor], and if liver functions are returning to normal; maybe it is a relapse. Approximately 80% (8 out of 10 patients) die if they go into a coma. Recovery and the risk of the condition returning vary from patient to patient. If you are able to control underlying liver disease, then prognosis is good; in terms HE will not return/progress. Take care. Best regards,"}

You are suffering from Exercise induced Urticaria or Cholinergic urticaria. This is the allergic reaction to Physical exertion or sweat. Exercise induced Urticaria is caused by your body having an allergic response to exercise. Cholinergic urticaria is caused by sweating that results from a rise in your body temperature. Exercising in hot weather makes you more susceptible to cholinergic urticaria. Both Exercise induced Urticaria or Cholinergic Urticaria both needs attention, and you should consult Allergy and Asthma specialist now. You should stop exercising because it may aggravate the allergy and lead to life-threatening conditions like difficulty in breathing (As you already have asthma, exercise is not advisable till you consult the specialist). Both conditions well respond to Antihistamines like cetirizine. If you have cholinergic urticaria, rapid cooling in a cold shower can help relieve symptoms. If you have an allergic reaction to exercise or sweating, always take your medications as prescribed to avoid hives. You may need to avoid vigorous-intensity exercises or follow an approved exercise routine after discussion with Allergy specialist. For cholinergic urticaria and heat rash, preventing sweating is the best way to prevent hives. Exercise in an air-conditioned area and wear lightweight clothing.

What can I do to help my self?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult spine surgeon. Your disc bulging is causing compression of nerves, coming out from disc space. And this compression, when severe, can cause loss of power (paralysis) of lower limb and neuritic type of pain. So at present you can take painkiller but for permanent solution you need surgical procedure to reduce compression. Also start vitamin B 12 as it is helpful in nerve repair and its function.

I would suggest take up a complete urine examination along with urea and creatinine levels. Some kidney donors, later in life may lose their kidney function and may require dialysis in the future. To minimize the complications it is better to assess renal health even in apparently healthy donor, even after years. Pain can also be caused due to urinary tract infection, and can be treated easily with the help of antibiotics based on urine culture/sensitivity.

Contrary to popular belief, many women have irregular menstrual cycles and skip periods occasionally. Stress, weight changes, traveling, or even worrying about unplanned pregnancy can cause you to miss your period. There are other hormonal conditions and medical issues that can also affect your menstrual cycle. What I suggest you do with this point is just wait and see. Your period is only one week late, so I would just see if you get it later this month. I would continue to use pregnancy protection with your partner during this time if you do not desire pregnancy, because just because you haven't menstruated doesn't mean you don't ovulate. Generally, I recommend evaluation by a gynecologist or medical doctor if you have missed your period more than three months. In addition, medication can be prescribed for you to restart your menstrual cycle if you have hormonal irregularities. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring. Best wishes,"}

This is the basis for gastronomic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

This especially seems to happen after having alcoholic beverages (though not in excess).", "output": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. These palpitation has to do with a rhythm issue. There are some electrical impulses that generates from parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. They cause a premature heart contraction that it's not a normal one. You feel this like e palpitation, a skipped beat or a fluttering sensation.Also, you might experience dizziness, difficulties in breathing deeply, anxiety. There might be different causes of this rhythm issues from simple emotional stress, coffee or energy Chat Doctor. If you have noticed this palpitation after alcohol consumption, then it might be the cause. In these circumstances you can try to avoid it. If it happens again than I would recommend some examination like a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and valves, a full blood analyze to exclude anemia, hyperthyroidism or electrolyte imbalance and of course a holder rhythm monitoring to see what are this palpitation and their frequency. After these we can judge how to deal with them. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, "}

The redness that your have noticed on the labia major of your child is likely to be a diaper rash. It maybe avoided by frequent changing of diapers, cleaning of the area and keeping the area Chat Doctor.  Also while cleaning make sure you clean from front to back i.e. vagina to anus. This would prevent any infection from the anal canal to affect the vagina. Apart from that, you may try applying any zinc oxide containing rash cream around the vaginal opening(not inside). Having said, so I suggest you also keep a watch for any discharge from the opening, difficulty in passing urine or increase in rash in which case a medical consultation would be advisable. Try to prevent her from itching the area as it may exacerbate the rash. If you have any more doubt do write back."}

Also, its turned from random times a year to now random times this week", "output": "Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Well, I would start my answer by describing you the anginal pain (pain derived from heart when it is suffering from insufficient blood inflow caused by narrowed coronary arteries). It is described more as a tenderness or heaviness in the midchest, radiating to the both sides of the chest, the jaw, left shoulder and/or arm, which is triggered by physical activity and terminated by stopping the physical activity. The pain you are experiencing, which is, I assume, not related to the heartburn, as you describe it, may come from an inflammation on the linings within the chests, like pleura (lining of the lungs) or pericardium (lining of the heart), or an inflammatory/infectious process in the bronchi/lungs. In this scenario, where pain has an inspiration-expiration variability, I would recommend you to get a plain chest X-ray and an EKG and/or an echocardiogram, to determine whether any of these linings is causing the pain. As for the heartburn, the major factor causing them is the excess production of acid after taking certain meals (like, Anthony derivatives, such as coffee, energy Chat Doctor.  If you are still experiencing this king of symptom, I think you should try a course with a protein pump inhibitor (PPI: omeprazole, omeprazole etc.) "}

She however has developed allergic asthma and gets pains in the chest where the pneumonia had occurred. It is unusual for the pain to be related to the previous pneumonia episode, unless she has had further lung problems and has left lung scarring, in medical terms this is known as fibrosis. Lung fibrosis can lead to several complications, and if there is evidence of bronchiectasis on HRCT scans, pain in that area can happen as sputum production continues and the constant cough leaves one with pain. My suggestion would be to get proper investigations done, such as HRCT Chest, lung function studies with DCO (that shows the current lung function with regard to oxygen diffusion) and get these reviewed by a Chest Physician. Rib pain can also be a possibility if there has been a recent fall, and the CT will pick this up as well. Please ensure that the asthma is also optimally controlled.

Let me give you a slight insight into what this shaking could be, the term jitteriness refers to tremors in newborns. It is the representation of an exaggerated startle response. It is often confused for seizures (also known as convulsion and fits), which naturally unnerves the parents. It is the most common involuntary movement seen in infants, which disappears completely as they mature. The neurodevelopmental of the babies with no other overt neurological sign but tremulousness is generally good, especially when there is no history of complications during pregnancy, or immediately before and after birth. Involves jaw and limbs. Jittering is easily initiated in newborns by external stimuli such as handling the baby or loud noise. It can be easily stopped by:1.) Gentle flexing (bending) of the affected limb.2.) Just holding the limb firmly and reassuringly.3.) Initiating the babies sucking action also stops the jittery movements. The tremulous movements are most frequently seen during the first few days of life in normal mature babies. It may extend throughout the neonatal period. It usually resolves spontaneously by two months of age. But some infants, with no neurological compromise, may continue to be tremulous till seven to nine months of age. If you notice any other developmental delay in baby or symptoms getting worse over time, kindly see a doctor. Go for regular postnatal check-ups and for now only observe the baby.

So take proton pump inhibitors. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first rule out arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks"}

A hematoma of the liver is a fairly common finding on scans of the abdomen. Not all hematomas need treatment. Only large hematomas and symptomatic hematomas need any treatment. Some hematomas can cause a dull achy pain in the upper belly, especially the bigger ones. Sometimes the hematoma may clot and cause severe pain, or some may cause bleeding. Very rarely, they can also decrease in platelet counts. In your friends case, the size of the hematoma (16cms) is definitely a cause for concern. But if the hematoma is located deep in the liver, the chances of rupture are very rare, and it is OK to wait and watch and plan for a repeat scan in the near future.

But surgically speaking, it is fairly common to resect (cut) the tail of the pancreas when removing the spleen, esp when the tail is buried deep in the spleen and more so in an emergency (as was in your case). But this does not in any way affect the health of the patient as the pancreas heals by itself. We routinely resect the tail of the pancreas in patients who develop some tumors of the distal pancreas, and they do very well postoperatively. Regarding your bones getting thin, I am not sure what you mean, but if you meant weak, I would suggest some vitamin D and calcium supplements. Hope you feel better soon."}

Is a chest x-ray my next option?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely be concerned for this repeated bronchitis. Best treatment for bronchitis is inhaled treatment. Since you are not taking inhaled treatment, you are not improving completely. In my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

Please help.", "output": "Hi, In the current scenario, you should get a physical exam and a trans-vaginal/ pelvic sonogram to exclude pregnancy along with the blood pregnancy test. With the past history of recurrent abortions, hormonal imbalance should be suspected. Metformin corrects ovulation disturbances by maintaining insulin balance. Also, the causes for the abortions in the past should be known for further management. If pregnancy is excluded, and no obvious cause for the excess discharge and pain can be seen, you can use some antispasmodic and take rest. Hope this helps."}

It isn t the first time.", "output": "Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. To my opinion you experienced a sudden decrease of blood pressure or decrease in cerebral blood flow, which is affected by hot water. The reason is quite simple. While most of the blood is directed to the skin to make the thermoregulation in front of the change of temperature due to the hot water, there remains less blood to supply the brain, thus experiencing a faint like episode. If you had a meal before the bath, some blood goes to the digestive system, extracting from the necessary amount to supply the brain. So don't worry. Don't eat before the bath. Consume enough liquids and take the bath to a lower temperature. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us.

You need to get done CT scan every three monthly and if nodule is increasing in size then biopsy is needed to confirm malignancy. But if nodule is static or decreasing in size then no need to worry about malignancy. It might be due to benign cyst or fibrosis. So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

When doing so I did the wrong thing and used my back to try and lift it. When I did this I could feel a tearing down the middle of my back on both sides of my spine. It felt like it was in the middle of my back but it could have been higher or lower. After doing so I started to feel pain in the front part of my legs and in the front of my lower abdomen. I decided to take some Ibuprofen and lay on the floor on my back, feet and legs elevated and an ice pack under my back 20 minutes on and off. I did this for a few hours. The front leg and abdomen pain has subsided for the most part. But now I have pain in both sides of my upper back just below my shoulder blades and moves around to the front of my lower rib cage. And my hands are slightly numb. If I try to bend over to pick something up I have great pain in my lower back. But I can raise myself up and down by using my legs and Knees and keeping by back straight.

Muscle pain, intense ear pain with tingling in my head. Anxiety and stomach upsetness. I noticed that as I get older the side effects become less and less.

I noticed that when i turn my head to a specific direction, there is a crunching noise in my right ear.

I m wondering if this is all in my head and if i should just wait till it goes away.. i mean it doesnt hurt or anything. I can live through it. also my chin and cheeks tend to get numb and tingly. Any suggestions? Is this normal? Do i really need to go to the doctors for this?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for the query. Plan B contains levonorgestrel. It can be used for emergency contraception. Usually emergency contraceptive pills present with symptoms like nausea, breast tenderness, bloating sensation etc. For more details : http://srsree.blogspot.in/2012/08/emergency-contraceptive-pill-short-term.htmlBut causing neurological problems is somewhat abnormal with contraceptive pills. They can cause headache, dizziness etc. But pain in ears, numbness etc. are not common side effects of emergency pills.

Regards, RB", "output": "Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

Another note,not sure if its related,ill occasionally have pains in my chest and ribs. Ive had bronchitis before but im not sure what this is.", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis is more. Bronchitis can precipitate in certain weather conditions. And your symptoms liked breathlessness, chest pain etc. are more suggestive of bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I have had this happen before in the last couple of years, the doctors tested me for all sorts of things and everything came back negative with the exception of them saying that they could see very minor amounts of bacteria. They prescribed me flagyl, which made me sick.. then they gave me clyndamicin, which I opted not to take and instead used boric acid suppositories.. that seemed to clear it right up. Well, it is back and has been for about a week, it has been about 8 months since the last flare up. I have been using boric acid and it didn t help.. I still had the clyndamicin so I opted to go ahead and take it this time, and I m about halfway through.. (4x a day for 2 weeks).. and I m not getting any relief yet.. I have been with the same partner for 2 years now, and I m certain he is faithful as we work and live together.. so WHAT IS GOING ON?..I bought one of the OTC screening tests .. and the yellow did turn a little bluish.. which indicates bacteria not yeast.. but why am I only experiencing burning and no other symptoms.. is this BV? Cervicitis? Urethritis?.. or does it matter? it is all a form of a bacterial infection that is all treated the same way.

However, when I was off the anti biotics, I began drinking alcohol again and sleeping with my partner again and it has seemed to return again! Although it is no way near as bad as it was, my side is very painful and it stings a little bit to urinate. I first slept with my partner in August and through the August/September time I was absolutely fine when he was using protection with no problems. I am starting to think it is something to do with my birth control pills. Do you think I should come off the pill for a month and start to use protection? Or perhaps change to another pill? I would greatly appreciate your help Thanks, Katie Lillywhite", "output": "Hiring infections are sometimes very difficult to treat and require the right antibiotic. Firstly make sure a urine culture has been done and the antibiotic you are taking is the right one. Secondly intercourse increases chances of having a urine infection, so you are having recurrent infections using a condom would be a good idea. Lastly, birth control pills do not cause urine infection, so you might want to continue them for added protection. Please remember some antibiotics reduce the effectiveness of these pills and cause unintentional pregnancies. Let me know if you have any other queriesThanks"}

{"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "I was born in a remote village with bilateral UN-descended testicles. Due to lack of awareness, my parents did not know the seriousness of the problem and also the local doctor in the small town did not advise them to get my testis descended through surgery well in time. On occasions while I was playing or running during my childhood and adolescence , I used to have swelling and pain on the sides of the root of penis where the testicles were probably stuck. The local doctor advised to rub Iodine ointment and relax. Ultimately I used to get relieved. Anyway, both the testicles were descended one by one through surgeries when I was 28. I got married at the age of 29 and was not aware of my problem as I did not face any erection problems and used to have night falls occasionally. After one and half year of our marriage without pregnancy, we approached our family GP to discuss the issue. I was asked to go through a semen analysis and it was revealed that I have zero sperm count. Following the physical examination of my testis, I was explained by the doctors that the size of the testis is small and that biopsy might not be very helpful. Their conclusion based on their experience was that the azoospermia may be irreversible. As I was following up developments in male infertility on some of the related websites and forums on the Internet, I was very happy when come to kmow from your website that there have been some successes in similar cases l. recently have semen s analysis but no sperms were observed.please let me know what tests report i should send u", "output": "Hi, I understand your problem. Following is my reply : 1) Unfortunately. Your descended testis may not give any sperms even if you do biopsy as they are small size. 2) even if you are not satisfied and want to get tested, toucan get tested by doing biopsy. 3) if any sperms are found during the biopsy or FNAC, you can undergo IVF / CSI treatment. 4) If you still have descended testis, i advice you to get your testis removed because there are chances of descended testis undergoing cancer in the future.regard, Chat Doctor.

Cirrhosis since long duration may develop portal hypertension due to which rate of blood cells breakdown into spleen would increase (so size of spleen would increase).2) Portal hypertension cause dilatation of vessels at lower part of esophagus as a natural process in effort to normalize portal pressure. Sometimes these esophageal vessels dilate such extent that it rupture during swallowing of hard food and cause blood containing vomiting.3) Increased Hemoglobin level, platelet count suggest maintained turn-over rate (production vs breakdown) of blood cells.4) Maring\u00e1 has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory property mainly, but it does not have any role in increasing value of hemoglobin."}

Is insulin must or can be controlled with medications.kindly suggest.", "output": "Hi, After going through your mothers case, I would like to advise you - Insulin is definitely the one of the best option for her because 1) She recently has undergone PTC to RCA (angioplasty). If indication for PTC was recent heart attack then insulin is the best option with her blood sugar levels of 300 & 400.2) She is already on 3 different types of Medicine for diabetes and on that her blood sugar levels were 170-220. In that case beside use of insulin alone or in combination with oral medicine, only few options are available which may be costlier, and we cannot assure better sugar control with them. 3) Use of different types of oral medicine in her case also depends on her kidney, heart status (which can be known from her serum creatinine level and left ventricular ejection fraction on 2DEcho) Metformin is avoided in case of Deranged serum creatinine and low ejection fraction. Glipizide is avoided with high serum creatinine level. Pioglitazone is avoided in case of signs water retention in body like breathlessness, swelling over legs, significant weight gain. Chances of water retention increases with deranged kidney function, low LVEF.  Pioglitazone also avoided in old female due to increased risk of osteoporosis fractures. I would also like to advise 1) screening for other diabetic complications like nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, foot examination.2) strict compliance with her medications (for diabetes and for heart problem - blood thinners, Beta blockers, ACE/Arms, Statins as advised by cardiologist) and diet.3) Regular BP check4) keep cholesterol under control (use of statins). Keeping all this fact into consideration use of insulin (for which high degree of motivation is important) is highly recommended in her along with oral medications depending on her reports after consulting with your doctor. If she is really reluctant for use of insulin other oral newer medicines like DPP4 inhibitors can be taken after consulting with planetologist."}

However, these are transient, and you would completely recover within 6-12 weeks. 2. Anxiety neurosis- as you have also mentioned, many of these symptoms could be because of anxiety.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Differential count is necessary to make a diagnosis. 2. 57000 is too high and could be due to mainly chronic lymphocytes leukemia at this age or secondary to bone marrow occupying lesion.3.

What should I avoid doing? (until I talk to dr.)", "output": "Hi, Yes, an MRI would definitely be indicated in your case, and you should probably get one done. X-rays show only the bony abnormalities and do not tell us anything much about nerve root compression which is the cause of sciatica, numbness, weakness, etc. An MRI would give these details.  Subluxation indicates movement of one vertebra over the adjacent (I'm assuming it is anterior subluxation of L4 over L5) and retrolisthesis means backward movement of the vertebra over the lower one (L3 over L4). These are usually due to break in the posterior vertebral portion (lysis) or due to facial arthropathy, both of which are not mentioned in your X-ray report.  Subluxation/listless often leads to compression of nerve roots and needs to be operated if symptoms are severe. You would need to meet an orthopedic surgeon to discuss your options. Till then, avoid lifting heavy objects, doing heavy work, etc. and wear a lumbar support (belt) if you have one. Sincerely, Vamshi"}

Not the pleasantest of experience for her and not something I wanted to do but I had to do it for peace of mind. Anyway, they all came back negative (I was surprised because I though her iron may be low).

Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holder monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation. Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. You should not worry about this. I will try to explain you something. When you do the angiography a substance called contrast is injected into you blood, into your coronary artery to make them visible and look for stenosis. This contrast is than eliminated through the kidney and goes outside the organisms with urinary output. During the first 48 hours after the angiography, as the contrast in still in our body it might house hypotension, nausea, vomiting. This is quite normal after the procedure. But usually after 48 h it is eliminated from the organism. So, if the angiography was normal, if the renal function after was normal and if 48 h has passed every think should come back to normal. The blood pressure values of 115/75 are quite normal, you should not worry about this.These values are our goal. So in my opinion your symptoms are not related with angiography, it might be just a flu that soon will pass. Or it might just be a little streets as you experience even fast heart beats. If the symptoms persist if I was your treating doctor I will recommend a full blood analyze to find a reason why you feel tired or this nausea. Hope I was helpful. Best regards."}

When you have an asthma exacerbation (acute attack), taking Stalin inhaler 4 times a day usually does not cause side effect (except hand tremors in some cases). But It's for a few days only. Once your attack is over and even then you need to take Stalin inhaler for 4 times a day, it's bad.

But the main thing is that you had few dizzy spells and the urine frequency also seems to be increased, so I would suggest you to wait for another 3-4 days and then repeat a urine pregnancy test and if that is positive you are pregnant. The reason for the wait and repeat is that many times it happens that the conception is late;so till you repeat pregnancy test please don't take any unnecessary medicine as you may be pregnant.

He had no jaundice and was of reasonable body status. Guided FNAC was done and suggested undifferentiated adenocarcinoma as the pathology.

I have gone through the details. Si it seems an unresectable pancreatic cancer with a suspicious liver lesion. Approach would be to do an FNAC of the liver lesion if it is metastasis then do palliative therapy. If no then do initial chemo or radio chemo to shrink the tumor and make it respectable. Since pancreatic tumors cause severe cathexis and loss of appetite and also patient is vomiting, it is a good approach to do a feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy to provide adequate nutrition.

Have been experiencing deep brochial coughing.   Could I have pulled a muscle during coughing spell.", "output": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are having mostly HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Uncontrolled HERD is the common cause for worsening of COPD. And chest heaviness with bloated stomach are the features of HERD more. But better to rule out cardiac cause first as COPD patients and at high risk for cardiac disease. So get done ECG.  If ECG is normal then HERD is likely cause. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. So try to follow these steps. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start Proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. 7. Avoid alcohol and smoking if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright."}

A lump the size of a marble behind the neck is most likely a cyst or a lymph node. It will be nice if you might consult a surgeon and have a confirmed diagnosis made. A cancer is less likely if it has appeared suddenly in a few days or present for months without any change in size. The surgeon might conclude a confirmed diagnosis after clinical examination or ask for a FNAC test to know if it is a particular type of swelling. Since the swelling is moving over the skin therefore it is not fixed to the deeper layers of tissue and less likely malignant. Please do not worry."}

If the heart beat is slow you will feel light-headed, sweating etc. Pain in the joints can be due to the inflammation of the joints called arthropathy.a definite diagnosis can be made only after clinical examination and relevant investigations.I would advise you to meet your physician regarding this. A clinical examination will help to understand the pain and weakness. A simple EKG will help to know the functioning of your heart. If all turns out negative then this might be due to anxiety alone which can be treated.I hope I have answered your query. Take care"}

Women are at increased risk of heart diseases during and after menopause. Since you are approaching menopause, you are at risk for heart diseases. There is no definitive period for development of heart disease. So at your age, it is always recommended to rule out heart diseases first for palpitations. So get done ECG, 2d echo and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Hormonal imbalance during menopause can also cause palpitations. So consult gynecologist for this. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

They were moving around lots of top grade soil so it was in the air, Im worried about the risk of Toxoplasmous. Have I exposed my baby to it by being around soil?", "output": "Dear user, Toxoplasmosis is acquired through contact with infected cat feces, by eating raw or undercooked meat, and by eating soil contaminated fruit or vegetables. There is no association with cat ownership. Adults most commonly acquire toxoplasmosis by environmental exposure, that is, ingestion of infectious cysts usually from soil contamination with cat feces. The greatest risk for the baby is vertical transmission in the first trimester. Thirty percent of exposed fetuses acquire the infection; however 85% of live infants appear normal at birth. To avoid your fear about your baby I will recommend you to do TORCH test (its free for pregnant women), a screening test that includes toxoplasmosis and some other infections which are harmful for the baby.

And in the past 2 weeks I have felt extremely depressed to the point where I randomly cry at things and get really upset and unhappy with my life even though i don t have any huge problems? I also get really paranoid and look too much into what people are saying to me. Also have been bleeding the whole time. Is this due to the pill and should I switch /come off it? Thanks!", "output": "Hi. Thanks for asking in Chat Doctor. Do not worry. The problems you are having are due to the influence of hormones present in Livest. The progesterone, Levonorgestrel in Livest is responsible for headache, mood swings, nausea, dizziness, depression and fatigue. Livest also results in bleeding/ spotting between periods. It may take a minimum period of three months for your body to get adjusted to the effects of such hormonal pills. If these side effects continue and interfere with your daily activities then you can switch for another OCP combination with lesser amount of progesterone. Traffic pills contain same amount of estrogen in all 21 tablets but varying strength of progesterone for every 7 pills in the pack.  Progesterone is started at a minimum dose and increased every 7 days. Traffic pills are claimed to mimic the hormonal pattern that occurs during a normal menstrual cycle. Since progesterone is causing the side effects you can consult your treating Chat Doctor. I hope this is useful to you."}

Looks like your friend has had a ligament injury to the ankle. The pop sound she's heard is suggestive of the same. For my patients, if the swelling was awful to begin with, along with inability to bear weight on the affected lower limb, I would firstly put a plaster cast for 4 weeks for the ligaments to heal and then remove it and start them on ankle exercises. If her pain and edema/ swelling are not so bad then compression/cr\u00eape bandaging should be sufficient. Rest, elevation of the involved leg and ice pack application are the additional supportive measures. So for your friend what I would advise is that if she has had this injury few weeks ago she should take rest for 3-5 days, avoid putting weight on the lower limb involved, minimum ambulation only to the bathroom if need be, and ice pack application locally.

Thank you for writing to us at Chat Doctor You seem to have developed an Acute sunburn. Bleaching the day before, did seem to have reduced the threshold for it to occur. If I was the treating doctor I would start you on Oral steroids for a week. Topically, you may use a moderately potent topical steroid e.g. fluticasone propionate 0.05% twice daily for a week. Steroids are anti-inflammatory and therefore bring down the redness and swelling associated with a sunburn. Steroids, oral as well as topical are anti-inflammatory, and I suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your vicinity for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate treatment. An OTC oral antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10 mg once daily will provide you symptomatic relief from discomfort. Always use a broad spectrum sunscreen throughout the day, whenever outdoors. Reapply every 2-3 hours. Regards"}

If she has breathing problems apart from exercise, I would suggest her taking montelukast alone for at least 2-3 months.2. If she has frequent nose symptoms also, I would suggest adding regular cetirizine or levocetirizine for at least 2-3 months.3. I would personally suggest her to get allergy testing done. This will help her know what she is allergic to and how to avoid it.4. It is perfect that she is using inhaler before she starts. However, if this is not enough, I would make two suggestions: a. To take a montelukast an hour before dancing. b. To perform a brief exercise (like running) for 5-10 minutes, approximately 45-60 minutes before her dancing time. This may help her to perform dancing session more smoothly.5. For leg weakness, I would suggest you to check her hemoglobin levels, if low, they should be corrected with oral iron, folic acid and vitamin B12. 6.

I can understand your concern. No, acidity and gastritis can not cause hypotension directly. In my opinion, you are mostly having stress and anxiety related symptoms. Stress and anxiety can cause HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which causes gastritis and acidity. And this stress and anxiety also causes high pulse rate, hypertension. But this is not permanent, similar to your case. When you are stressed, you will have gastritis, acidity, high pulse rate and hypertension, all together.

Food particles get trapped on and between the teeth after eating. Along with mucus, dead epithelial cells (from the mouth lining) and bacteria, a thin soft film, known as plaque coats the teeth. This provides the ideal medium for oral bacteria to feed upon food debris. Bacteria like Mutant streptococci and related groups, break down food particles and produce lactic acid as a byproduct. It is this lactic acid that is responsible for eroding tooth enamel and causing tooth cavities. Food + Mucus + Dead Cells + Bacteria = Soft Plaque (within 24 hours after brushing)Soft Plaque + Calcium +Phosphates + Other Compounds = Hard Plaque (within 72 hours of soft plaque formation)Left untreated, the lactic acid will continue to erode the enamel and dentin and cause irritation of the nerve which is experienced as a toothache. A toothache (painful and tender tooth) is a late symptom of an untreated tooth cavity. Toothaches may also be caused by an infection, injury or the absence of a tooth. Jaw pain may also occur as a result of a dental cavity as the nerve supply of a tooth follows a path around or near the jaw. However, jaw pain should not always be mistaken for a dental cavity as there can be other causes like TMJ dysfunction (temporomandibular joint syn Chat Doctor. Jaw pain may precede, be accompanied by or follow after a toothache and this jaw pain may often radiate around the side of the affected tooth.

You are known to get recurrence of urinary stones mostly due to metabolic disorder. Now you have four stones in Left kidney bigger one of the size of 7 mm. Normally stone up to size of 8 mm can be expected to pass out spontaneously.However, there are multiple factors that govern the passage of stone out 1) Shape of the stone 2) Diameter of mouth of calyx. The pain occurs even when the stone is in kidney and occurs when it gets impacted at the mouth of calyx causing distention of calyx due to accumulation of urine in calyx. As regards no of lithography that one can be subjected to I would say that due to advanced technology and modern lithography machines one can have ESL for plenty of times and there is no danger to pancreas or any other organ. Since you have stone of a size of 7 mm and less you can expect them to pass out spontaneously. If they fail to pass down within a month you can go ahead for ESL. Chat Doctor. "}

It is possible to be pregnant if you had intercourse during your fertile period (ovulation day and 3\u00a0days prior to that). This is usually in the middle third of your cycle. The spotting, vomiting don't seem related to pregnancy. It could be an isolated incident. A sure sign of a possible pregnancy is a missed period and positive pregnancy test after you have missed your period. Please take a home pregnancy test to check, once you have missed your period. If negative, I recommend :- basal body temperature monitoring & using ovulation prediction kits to detect ovulation day. This day and the three days before that are your most fertile period. -regular intercourse (every alternate day) in the middle third of your cycle (day 10 to 20 in a 30-day cycle, for instance). -minimize caffeine -maintain healthy diet and weight. -exercise regularly. Don't stress too much while trying. It doesn't help and In fact can negatively impact fertility. -take a folic acid supplement every day. -if below 30 yrs, try for a year and of above 30,for 6 months before seeking professional help.

Now though it always feels queasy and gurgles loudly. For many years I have been taking lot of drugs for arthritis and fibromyalgia - anti-inflammatories, diclofenac, plaqueniland omeprazole, and currently tramadol and paracetemol as necessary for back pain until i can have PLIF surgery to L2/3. I actually postponed the surgery because i thought the problem was due to anxiety about the operation, but it persists. I have had a gastroscopy last year which wasclear, and at that time i had no stomach symptoms.However lately my stomach squelches loudly and feels almost like its trying to process glue.i feel it right under my sternum all the way through my bowel. It not painful, but troublesome. Of course there is also gas, but naturally due to all the drugs i am constipated and have to use senna powder. Ive noticed that i am sensitive to gluten so have eliminated that from my diet, but the squelchy queasy feeling is still there. Last night for dinner I could only stomach pureed spinach and mashed sweet potato. This morning i was so nauseated after my breakfast of banana and fig smoothie with protein powder that it all came back up. Im 54, 53 and 73kg. Fit through exercise and natural foods (we grow all our own meat, fruit and vegetables and rarely eat out) but drink wine every day. I am reluctant to go to the doctor as there is so much else going on that i feel like a hypochondriac, which may be true, but it doesnt help the queasy sickness.", "output": "Hi. Thanks for an elucidated history. This is very true that all the combinations of medicines do cause the gastric upsets you described. Yet, it is always a better policy to get the organic causes ruled out, as you may not be in a position to stop all the medicines and see the results whether this helps to alleviated your stomach problem. I would still advise having one clinical examination, preferable by a Castro Doctor and undergo some simple tests like an X-ray abdomen in a standing position, Ultrasonography of abdomen after a good preparation of the bowels."}

I also felt nauseated. This lasted about 10 minutes. Then I felt a little better. Got up at 5 to go to work. While at work I didn t feel so hot. Not nauseated. Or like headache. I can t explain how I felt. I just felt off. Not quite right. This lasted till about 1/2 this afternoon. I feel ok now.", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your ordeal. Tingling in the arms can come from multiple causes: cervical radiculopathy (pinched nerve in the neck), peripheral neuropathy (typically related to diabetes, AIDS, or alcoholism), or from peripheral nerve compression (sleeping in a strange position or on an extremity). In your case with the constellation of symptoms you felt it is likely you may have had a vasovagal reaction from using the washroom. This type of reaction can occur when you strain and increase the tone to a nerve called the legal nerve. Typically, this causes sweating, nausea, and an uneasy feeling like you described. I'm glad the symptoms dissipated and hopefully this will not occur again. If the symptoms do return it is best to see your physician for a thorough physical exam. I hope this answer helps."}

In some people these changes can be more pronounced due to genetic factors, trauma, heavy physical work etc. As for what needs to be done, for the moment only physical therapy and over the counter anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen are recommended.

Is there a possibility that I might be pregnant? We have an unprotected sexual intercourse with my bf 3 days after my period last September 4. I dont experience spotting. Last few months we have a vigorous training and I suffer from weight loss. But now, I was wondering why I have clear nipple discharge from both of nipples.", "output": "Hello, I hope I can help you today. First, any woman having unprotected intercourse is at risk for pregnancy. In addition, missing your period is the most common sign of pregnancy. Weight loss due to exercise can also cause you to miss your period, so there is no way to know if you are pregnant based solely on symptoms. However, nipple discharge can be caused by other hormone abnormalities that can also cause irregular periods. An excess of the hormone Prolactin, which stimulates milk production, can be produced as a side effect of medications or even from a type of benign pituitary tumor. Depending on your age, abnormalities of the breast ducts or even rarely, breast cancer, can cause nipple discharge. So if you have not yet done so, you should perform an over the counter pregnancy test and if the results are negative, I recommend you see your local physician for an evaluation of your hormone levels. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Let me know if you have further queries. Best wishes,"}

You seem to be having one of the discs protruding between the bones and this protrusion is backwards and causing narrowing of the spinal canal. An 8 mm disc protrusion is a large one and can cause significant pinching of the nerve roots at L 4 - 5 level leading to severe pain in your back and legs. There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers.

I was wondering if its possible that I can be pregnant and would it be to early to take a home pregnancy test?", "output": "Hallow Dear, Considering 5 days of bleeding and 18 clear days before you start your menses, your menstrual cycle seems to be of 23 days. Then your day of egg release (ovulation) would be 11th day of menstruation. The egg is alive for 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Thus, day 7 to day 15 of your cycle would be fertile period for you. You had sexual intercourse on day 6 of the cycle, which is very close to the Fertile period. Therefore, possibility of conception cannot be ignored. It is barely 4 days that you have missed your period. The usual urine pregnancy tests are reliable 8-10 days after missed period; earlier the chances of false negative results are high. However, beta Chat Doctor tests are very specific and sensitive and can give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period. So you may opt for beta Chat Doctor test.

I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Looking at your age, history and complaints, I would first think of allergies and asthma, however, coughing of blood is not a usual feature of asthma, unless your cough was very severe.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you Chest X-ray and spirometry. Combining these investigations, your doctor will be reasonably able to decide whether you have asthma, COPD or something else, also what was the cause of coughing out blood.3. If it turns out to be asthma, I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances causing allergies to you and also to know the measures to avoid them. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually improves allergy symptoms by working on immunity.4. If your inhalers were previously working and now not working, I would suggest you to increase dose of \"asthma controller\" medications after consulting your doctor until your diagnosis is confirmed.5. Regular breathing exercise will help you in a long run by improving your lung capacity.6. Please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."}

After going through the history and short description of the lesion on your inner thigh, I feel, if I were your physician would like to consider/suggest followings:1. Sebaceous cysts are best treated by surgical excision only; as the contents once spilled out can initiate foreign-body reaction and recurrent abscess formation, it is always best to remove it before it is partially or completely ruptured or punctured! The remains of cyst wall, if any, can also create new cysts in the surroundings...!2. The cyst, when aged enough, gets black due to silent accumulation of blood components and melanin of the skin3. Once this is squeezed, the content comes out; it could be blood mixed pus, Cretaceous/chalky material, fluid etc. and leaves the cyst open to the environment thereby recurrent infection!4. Normal bleeding time is 2-5 minutes, so this was normal and always apply pressure to reduce blood loss5.

My wisdom teeth have been swelling for the past 6 months and I have been taking antibiotics as prescribed by my dentist when they do, until I get them removed.  2 days ago, Ive noticed that my finger/ nail bed is slightly infected and have been treating it with hot water baths and local antibiotic ointment.

Swelling of the gum flap over wisdom tooth is a condition called peritonitis, and it is also due to infection, as well as swelling of the nail bed is due to infection, but one does not cause the other. For peritonitis, you need to get checked by a Dentist and get antibiotics and also do warm saline gargles. Keep the area clean.

Just last night it was the same thing only he did finish inside but notin was wrong with the condom and it was used properly with no tears or holes. I had brown discharge right after sex last night and that had happened before but not that soon after sex. I know there s almost no chance I could e pregnant, or atleast hope there isn t. I know it s dumb of me to probably even worry...i have been getting a lot of cramps and I got discharge the week I was suppost to ovulate but assumed the birth control would stop that. Is all of the cramping and discharge normal for just switching pills? Am I freaking out for no reason??", "output": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Tri-Sprintec is a birth control pill that has a traffic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. Occasionally, women who take traffic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month.  This may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. Whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it.  Furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use. Both Sprinter and Tri-Sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. So you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill. Regarding pregnancy, the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills and using a condom is basically nonexistent. So I believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill.  If your desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects.

Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Even though it needs clinical assessment for a diagnosis, from your history, it seems that you have inflammation/calculi in your gall bladder/biliary system giving rise to such intermittent severe pain. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to avoid fatty/oily food which would precipitate the pain more due to contraction of the gall bladder to empty bile into the intestines.  I would advise you a bland diet, some routine investigations like a CBC, a blood sugar, liver function test, a serum amylase and lipase to rule out associated pancreatitis, and an ultrasound abdomen to see the status of the biliary tree including the gall bladder to exclude a stone causing cholecystitis and also to know the status of the pancreas.

It started out as a sharp pain that I could control by stopping breathing for a minute.  It became so regular that I stopped breathing without thinking about it.  There would be times I would get the pains while sleeping and would just stop breathing while sleeping to get the pain to go away.  Over the years, the pain progressed.  It would radiate throughout the back, ribs, and full chest.  The pains would not always be on a certain side of the body.  I can no longer stop the pains.  The pains have gotten so bad that they paralyze me anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes (the pain is so bad that I cant move).

Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

I can understand your concern. No need to worry about side effects by inhalers. Actually inhalers are very safe in long term use. They act locally and directly on lungs without going to blood. So inhalers don't act on other organs like kidney, heart, liver etc. So no systemic side effects by inhalers. You should also rinse your mouth after inhaler use to prevent oral complications. Also do pulmonary rehabilitation (deep breathing exercises and chest physiotherapy) for better symptomatic relief. So don't afraid of long term inhaler use. They are safe.

I have about 20-25 on each arm.  Might be caused by a liver that doesnt break down fat.They are hereditary. The ones my father had removed grew back, so that is not an option for me.  What can you suggest?", "output": "Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your query you have multiple lipomas around 20- 25 on each arm which is a pure benign condition and need not worry much about it. A lipoma is a slow-growing, fatty lump that's most often situated between your skin and the underlying muscle layer. A lipoma is NT cancer and usually is harmless. Treatment generally is not necessary, but if the lipoma bothers you, is painful or is growing, you may want to have it removed. You most likely have the diagnosis of familial lipomatous as you said your father had the same. Treatment can include simple excision, endoscopic removal, or liposuction if large. Liposuction, whether laser Liposuction or traditional will leave some lipoma cells behind which over time will probably recur though it may take years. So consult surgeon for proper examination and treatment. Applying Apple Cider Vinegar and turmeric powder will help in reducing the size of lipoma. Hope your concern has been resolved. Best Wishes,"}

I am now bleeding yet I am not sure if this is my regular period or not. Thank you for any advice.", "output": "Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion the diagnosis of pregnancy is possible by urine pregnancy or blood pregnancy tests and ultrasound. So only the presence of symptoms of pregnancy like nausea, vomitings, increased urination, sore breasts might give suspicion of pregnancy but not confirm it. The confirmation is possible only by investigations. So I suggest you to consider doing a urine pregnancy test done. Once the test is positive then the causes for bleeding during pregnancy like abnormal pregnancy like ectopic or miscarriage, thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency or any bleeding from cervix should be evaluated. The ectopic pregnancy presents with severe pain abdomen with or without spotting and weak positive urine pregnancy test. The transvaginal ultrasound confirms the ectopic pregnancy. When the ectopic pregnancy ruptures it will lead to severe bleeding in the abdominal cavity. This blood irritates the diaphragm and lead to shoulder pain. But there are many other causes for shoulder pain other than ectopic. I suggest you to check if it is really pregnancy or not to confirm the things but not just assume things and feel stressed. So relax. Avoid stress. Hope this helps. Best regards..."}

It is safe to have sexual intercourse between 14 weeks to 28 weeks of pregnancy if there is no specific contraindication. Later, physical contacts become quite bothersome and also the uterus is more irritable. During intercourse in the mid-trimester, full insertion of penis into the vagina should be avoided.

Firstly, Metformin has brought down your blood sugar to within desirable range, though the morning (empty stomach) blood sugar is still high.

Alarm features of severe disease are - excessive sleepiness, worsening jaundice, bleeding manifestations and swelling of the abdomen, which are not the case with you.

In June of this year I came down with pneumonia. 3 X-rays and 2 CT scans since I have a nodule in my upper portion of my left lung. They did biopsy on my lymph nodes and they came back negative. The nodule biopsy came back as a typical cells. now they want to do another CT scan with needle biopsy to get more information and next step would be take half the lung out to remove nodule. I am active and feel fine. My question is this, cant they just monitor the area instead of all these probes?", "output": "Diagnosing a pulmonary nodule can be a tricky feat. The best approach is to determine the likelihood of the nodule being cancerous or malignant. Having a smoking history is of course the strongest risk factor for cancer. The presence of atypical cells is also concerning for the possibility of cancer, although this by itself is not diagnostic. At this point, you can decide between removal of the nodule versus very close monitoring of the nodule with serial CT scans. Removal of the nodule may involve removing an entire lobe or just a segment, depending on the size of it. Monitoring with CT scans is an option, but you should talk to your doctor more about the characteristics of the nodule. There may be other factors that made your doctor feel that leaving the nodule there is risky. To summarize, both serial CT scans and removal of the nodule are options. Which one you choose should be based on the characteristics of the nodule, your risk factors, and the changes of the nodules on serial CT scans. I hope this provides some clarity to your situation."}

As your son is acting normally during the daytime and is able to sleep without crying or vomiting during the night, I believe you may safely watch him at night without concern about his position.

What is your BMI? Do you have regular cycles? Usually women with PRO have irregular cycles as they do not have regular ovulation. I suggest that you take closed/tamoxifen +In Chat Doctor for six cycles along with ultrasound follicular study. Ultrasound examination helps us to make sure that ovulation is occurring. If conception does not occur with this treatment then I would discuss with you two options of management. Either to start induction of ovulation with hormones or laparoscopy and ovarian diathermy for polycystic ovaries. Pregnancy rates between laparoscopic ovarian diathermy after 6 to 12 months follow up and six cycles of ovulation induction with gonadotropin are the same. Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy carries the risk of surgery. However, the rate of multiple pregnancies is lower in women who conceive after ovarian diathermy. Take one tablet of folic acid daily. To increases your chances of pregnancy, maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you are a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. For women with PRO maintaining normal BMI extremely important. Even reduction of just 5-10% of body weight corrects the hormonal imbalance and improves chances of conception.

I m on the bc pill for 5 months now. Yesterday I forgot to take the pill at night as I usually do, and so I took it when I got home at 6 p.m ... And I went to the bathroom and noticed that my panties had a little thick brown discharge, but I cleaned after going to the bathroom and the paper didn t show a thing! I m sexually active at the moment and I m waiting for the night to take the pill at the normal hour. Am I doing this right ? Can anything be wrong because of the discharge ? Patiently waiting an answer please!", "output": "Hello ma'am and welcome. As is advised, if a dose is missed you should take it as soon as you remember and everything should be fine. But if you miss two consecutive doses, then it is best to discontinue the pill and use other forms of contraception. As you missed only one dose and took it as soon as you remembered, the only side effect would be a slight hormonal change which is why you presented with such symptoms. There is nothing to worry about ma'am. Hope this helps. Best wishes."}

I am 22, 511 and 140-145 lbs.", "output": "Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I read your question carefully and understand your concern. Your symptoms seem to be related to anxiety. Your family history for atrial fibrillation doesn't seem to be related to your symptomatology. Has anybody besides you noticed the skin discoloration of your limbs? You are too young for such cardiac disorders. Anyway, a metabolic disorder (like thyroid dysfunction, etc.) can not be excluded. I recommend consulting with your GP for a careful physical examination and a complete check-up : - a resting ECG- a chest X-ray study - blood lab tests : complete blood count, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, fasting glucose, kidney and liver function tests, cortisol plasma levels, etc. A treadmill test and an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring may be necessary if suspicions of a cardiac arrhythmia are raised. If all the above tests result normal, the main cause of your symptoms would be just pure anxiety. In such case, I would recommend consulting with a specialist of this field to help you manage your anxiety. Hope to have been helpful! Best regards!"}

Perform Beta Chat Doctor test on your blood 10 days after the last unprotected sex. 2. Alternatively, wait for your menses to appear. Light bleeding may not be a true menstruation. If you get good menses, you are not pregnant. If they are delayed for more than a week, perform pregnancy test on overnight morning first urine sample; earlier the test may report false negative results.

Medicines and physical therapy usually form the first line of treatment for disc herniation which he has already tried for around 6 weeks. Another medicine which can be tried is pregabalin or gabapentin which is specifically for nerve pain. Depending upon the location of disc herniation in the MRI and the compressed nerve, selective nerve root block is a next option. It is an injection of a steroid and local anesthetic in the spine. This helps many patients and is also diagnostic that the compressed nerve is the problem. The injections can be repeated if needed. If the injection helps for some time, but pain recurs surgery (microdiscectomy) is indicated. Surgery is only for pain relief in the short term as results of surgery and no surgery are same at 2 years. At the age of 17 I would recommend trying all measures to control pain and avoiding surgery unless it becomes absolutely essential. Hope this is helpful. I would be happy to answer any questions."}

See you have to gauge risk to benefit of the medicine taking it for long time. If you are supposed to take it and that too in a particular dose, but you are not having it/taking lesser dose of same, in that case there are increased chances of having a fit.

Post which based in the extent of the nerve entrapment the treatment plan can be initiated. Nerve blocks which are termed as shots in the spine are advised to the patients who have severe pain. In most cases, such nerve blocks are taken in the later stages if the compression isn't getting relieved and the complaints of radiating pain is high. In most cases of my clinical practice of over 12 years, most lumbar and cervical spine cases have responded well to conservative management under physiotherapist guidance. For injury of the neck now I will advise you to use hot water fermentation along with a soft cervical collar. This will help reduce the radiating symptoms. Post this stabilizing the muscles of the neck and upper limb is advised. Once the pain level comes in between 5-6 on the visual analogue pain scale than exercise to strengthen the neck and upper limb muscles along with core and lower limb should give you good results.

{"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "Hi,I have been with my partner for 3 years we just got married 2 months ago.  I was tested for all STDs going into the relationship and again when I was pregnant with my now 18 month old.  I had a pap smear in April 2009 but am not sure if I was tested for stds.  I had a copper IUD put in me late December and when I went for my check up in Jan they took swabs when I complained of abdominal pain and having to pee frequently.  They came back clean but I phoned up my GP for antibiotics for a UTI since this is fairly common after having an IUD put in the Dr didnt test for it.  Well the pain went away but come back a couple of weeks later.  I put it to the back of my head as was very busy with exams and planning wedding plus thought I had to suffer through it cause of the IUD.  We went away on honeymoon and had pain while sex.  I thought it was the IUD and went to have it checked and was sent to another clinic after the first clinic took swabs.  They did swabs at second clinic and both tests came back positive with Chlamydia!  I have not cheated and the only person that I have had sex with is my husband for the past 3 years.  Of course I accused him of cheating and he swore that he hasnt cheated on me.  He went to get a full STD check and to add to the confusion he has come back negative for any STDs.  I am so confused as to how I could have gotten this.Before my husband got tested I was told that it was possible that he had Chlamydia and I was resistant to it and then when my IUD was put in I finally caught it.  Is it possible for my husband to be carrying Chlamydia but not have it and not test positive for it?Also I am worried that I have something else perhaps cervical cancer and it has had a reaction with the IUD and given me false positive results??  I am still peeing frequently and having abdominal pain even though I have completed all my antibiotics.  I will add that I have not had sex with my husband since all this has gone down and also he when he went to the clinic they gave him treatment for it even though they hadnt gotten his test results back yet.I am so confused and upset and I need answers as this is taking over my life.", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. First, no need to worry about cervical cancer because you're all reports are negative for cancer. You are having chlamydia infection due to IUD in uterus. IUD weakens local uterine defense system, so women on IUD are more prone to STD s. You are mostly infected through your husband. Male urethra is very protective against infection. So your husband might be carrying chlamydia without infecting him. And during sexual Intercourse, you are infected. Since your defense system is weak due to IUD, you are having symptoms of infection. So better to get done sensitivity report for guidance of effective antibiotic therapy. No need to worry about cervical cancer. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

I appreciate your concern regarding this issue and I shall help where I can. There are a few issues that need to be excluded here, but you would have to see your GP in order to perform the correct tests. By doing so you will be able to determine the cause of your symptoms, and you can then receive the appropriate management for it. A simple test could be done to your urine called a dipstick test where a test strip is used to determine whether they are any abnormalities with the urine. If there is blood in the urine then further investigations will need to be done such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out kidney stones for example. The test would also be able to pick up if there are any signs of infection which could also be causing your symptoms. Other products such as glucose and proteins can also be detected in the urine this way and if so, further investigations will have to be done to rule out other systemic problems such as diabetes and liver related pathology. I hope this helps and good luck."}

I studied all details of your query. I understood your health concerns about remedy of a lump on artery in the neck. Based on facts of your query, it seems that-you have a lump of infective origin with your earache. Due to its weird progress, many causes need to be worked up. ENT Surgeon has already asked a CT Scan. Second course with changed antibiotic controlled its swelling, but the lump got bigger. In such a scenario I Would suggest Second Opinion from another ENT Surgeon in the meanwhile. In my opinion-this could be Bronchial Cleft lump of first/or atypical second bronchial cleft/ or could be hidden Cystic Aroma with Infection. The association of the earache, increases its possibility of being First Bronchial Cleft which extends to external auditory canal. But its relation with the carotid artery needs to be confirmed as, in that case Second Bronchial Cyst possibility increases. These are congenital anomalies due to embryological defects in the closure of the clefts. Remedy-Conservative approach is preferred due to the proximity with carotid bifurcation. Surgery does not guarantee recurrence and hence Conservation is to be preferred. Hope this reply would help you in resolving this complex query and anxiety with it.

The logic is implantation of baby into uterus occurs on the 6th-7th day after ovulation. With implantation, pregnancy hormone is secreted, and it can be detected by tests. This is the earliest time to do pregnancy test. Urine test may not detect it. You need to do blood pregnancy test. So only when you have sex at the time /just after ovulation pregnancy test can be done after 6-7 days. What you have heard is right. The first week and the last week of a menstrual cycle are safe. A woman cannot get pregnant if she has unprotected sex during this period. I hope I have answered your concerns."}

I am a 21 year old Female. It is getting to the point where it is waking me up, and hurts to walk. Is it time to see a doctor, or is it something not serious at all?", "output": "Hello! I read carefully your query and understand your concerns. There are many possible causes of this pain in your lower right abdomen that has progressed to both sides .1)It might be related to a problem in digestive tract: it might be appendicitis, diverticulitis, irritable bowel syn Chat Doctor. 2)It might be due to a condition of urinary tract : urinary tract infection, kidney infection, kidney stones, cystitis etc.3) Or it might due to a condition of your reproductive tract :Problems with the cervix, such as a cervical infection, pain associated with ovulation, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease etc. Since there is this large number of possible causes, associated symptoms, specific characteristic of the pain (the moment of the initiation, the severity, radiation of the pain, the relation with the periods etc.) provide very important information to get to the right diagnosis. Since there has been some days with this pain, and it is getting stronger, I think it is time to consult a physician. A detailed medical history and detailed physical examination are needed.

The influenza vaccine should be taken in the autumn before winter sets in for it to be effective. People with egg allergy can have the influenza vaccine provided the lowest cut off limit of egg protein in the vaccine is used.

I was wondering if it is worth it to get and if it really will affect my smile?thanks!", "output": "Chin augmentation can affect your smile due to following reasons:- During the procedure of putting the implant certain nerves responsible for movement of lower lip can be damaged(Partially, totally or just get stretched). This will cause defective movements of lower lip hence affecting you smile. It may take few weeks to as long as 18\u00a0months for these damaged nerves to recover. Besides movements lower lip can become numb(i.e. less sensation) Also as lower lip and chin are part full expression of smile any change in shape and size will definitely affect the overall smile which may or may not be better than you your original smile. An experienced cosmetic surgeon can help you to come to conclusion that whether the new smile will be more appropriate and attractive than the present situation. There are many computer animations programs available to predict your future smile, You must consider above-mentioned points before undergoing surgery.

It was slightly irritated but I didn t think anything of it. Over the next several weeks, instead of going away, it got much bigger. Now it s about the size of a large pea. It was flesh colored for a while until I researched and found it was probably a dermatofibroma which could potentially be frozen off. I tried a few nitrogen freezing sessions on it and all I ve managed to do is destroy my skin and make the bump permanently red. It will sometimes itch and it hurts a lot when it s bumped (but it s also on the back of my boney hand). I am uninsured and have asked around and it apparently could cost about $750 to have it removed. Are there differentiating characteristics between dermatofibroma and nodular melanoma that I may use to narrow down how important this could be to remove? I tried the pinch test but the skin is so damaged it doesn t move over the bump. Thank you!", "output": "Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. By the facts of your query, You neither have Dermatofibroma nor nodular melanoma on back of your left hand.Don't treat by self diagnosis, which could complicate a simple problem in to complex issue like yours.

Is the stinging feeling modulated by body movements or breathing? A musculoskeletal pain would be modulated from the respiratory movements. Does medium make any changes to your condition? Have you tried any painkillers? I would not exclude a pinched thoracic nerve, which could mimic a similar clinical scenario. I recommend consulting with the neurologist for a careful physical examination for neurological signs and performing a chest x-ray, a routine blood test and a cervico-thoracal spine x-ray to exclude any other possible cause.

Our body constitution is genetically determined, even before we are born and there is limitation to what we can do to alter it.

In kids like you, this center does not know when to stop and this makes us constantly hungry and this in turn adds to our weight. There are millions of kids like you all over the world, and you are not the only one having this problem. What makes a difference is the STRONG WILL to limit food intake specially the ones we like most such as ice-creams, chocolates, deep-fried items etc. It would be healthy if you could replace these things with fruits and vegetables and make special effort to move out and play and interact with your friends and if possible go for regular swimming.

Since you are healthy, and this issue is there for 3 years, it is unlikely to have a serious underlying cause(I guess you have no hypertension/edema on legs/red colored urine/increase or decreased urine output).Anyhow, you can do a urine routine examination. Depending on the result, you may need some blood tests like complete blood count/renal function test. The first thing to be sure before going for these investigations is that, the substances are not coming from your vagina, and get mixed up with urine. I hope you will find this information useful.

If X-ray is normal and MRI is showing arthritis changes it means disease is early and replacement can be delayed. If X-ray changes are obvious total joint replacement is the best option. It is very rewarding surgery with excellent results. Prosthesis shelf life is also long nowadays and long term studies are also available. Other option is joint fusion which is absolute procedure and gas poor results."}

It skips about three times while Im checking my blood pressure.  Is this anything that needs immediate treatment or can it wait until I can see a doctor.", "output": "Hello there, and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I totally understand your concern. Don't worry, It's nothing serious. As you describe, my opinion is that we are dealing probably with exstrasystoles. These are electrical impulses generating from parts of the heart different from that of normal sinus rhythm. They cause this escaped or skipping beats. You may feel a palpitation, an anxiety sensation or like a beat is skipping. There are different reasons that may generate an extrasystol from simple emotional street to different pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. Hypertension and exstrasystoles are independent of each other meaning that you may have extrasystoles without having hypertension, you may have hypertension without extrasystoles or both of them. The fact that you have a low blood pressure is a good news you don't have to worry about this. In fact this is our goal when we treat hypertension. Now we have to deal with this skipping beats. My opinion as a cardiologist is that we are not talking for something urgent. I will recommend you to tell your symptoms to your treating doctor in your next visit to make some simple examinations like a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones. Of course if I was your treating I will recommend a holder monitoring to register and see what happens with your rhythm during these symptoms. If you feel that your heart is beating in a chaotic way it is advisable to make an electrocardiogram in that exact moment to your nearest cardiologist. In mean time avoid coffee and caffeine products because they exacerbate these symptoms. When we document and see what kind of rhythm problem is this we can talk about treatment. Hope I was helpful.

They include severe exzema, joint pain, reduced interest in sex, foul smelling semen, extreme tiredness, unable to sleep through out the night even with melatonin.", "output": "Eczema and joint pain are not related to sexual disinterest. However, continuous insomnia and severity of joint pains may be connected due to interfering each other. This may, in some cases, cause lack of sexual enjoyment, but it is not a rule. You should treat these separately in allopatry. However, in Ayurveda data humor vitiation theory fits insomnia, joint pains, impotency etc. but not skin as a general rule. In my own patients cases I would treat them with mild duration and Intestinal unctuousness, appetizers and nerving tonics like Ashwagandha herb and allied preparations. This would ad Chat Doctor. When nerving tonics added with dhatupaushtik i.e. semen thickeners, the foul smell will go. For the time being a lot of water should be given along with Joshua and Pikachu herbal capsules of Himalaya co. If you agree, may write direct question for further guidance and treatment.

Since you have symptoms like balance issues, pain, numbness, restless etc. we need to focus here on two aspects. One is the brain and the second is the spinal column. Brain works on its own and the input of medicine is symptomatic to get help for the symptoms. Also the MRI of the brain and spine will play a key role to your diagnosis and help for further. Medicinal part will be played by consulting a specialist and then the non-invasive was of dealing is the physical therapy. You can always meet a physical therapist who will assess and guide the next course of plan by using TENS and exercises. Why exercise again is to help boost the metabolism and come closer to the requirements of the tissue. It will even help for balance disorders, pain, spondylosis etc. With the grace of God is wish you a speedy recovery"}

But even the negative results doesn't exclude herpes. I usually give antiviral treatment acyclovir or acyclovir for at least five days in my patients with such case. Acyclovir ointment for local application also will be helpful. Avoid wearing tight clothes which may irritate the blisters. Keep area clean by using saline water. You can apply ice pack or wet tea bags to soothe pain. It can recur after this also when your immunity becomes low. So episodic treatment should be done in such case. Thank you."}

When i masturbate i get an erection but ejaculate within a short time. I have undergone MRI of spine(3 times) and brain(1 time) which showed normal results.

Could you please provide your suggestion. Thanks XYZ", "output": "Hi, If your MRI was done thrice, and it was normal on all three occasions, you might have to get some other tests performed. There are neurologists who check for nerve conduction defects. Sometimes these are useful in such a clinical scenario. We should ideally not think of your two problems (poor erections and bladder muscle weakness) as separate entities and should check if one solution will help both problems. There are other investigations which can also be performed. These include a penile Doppler to test vascularity of your phallus. You can also be tried with medications like alpha-blockers to see if urine flow improves, and if required also add medication to improve bladder muscle tone which unfortunately is not very often successful. Hope I have been able to help you."}

Read your query. Using a new tooth brush and a toothpaste will not cause any bleeding. Bleeding while brushing will be because of gingivitis(gums inflamed) or u may have put more pressure on the gums, so it caused a little bleeding.

I would suggest you skin prick tests for common aero-allergens like house dust mites, molds, regional pollen, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. Usually qualified Allergists perform such skin prick tests.2. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms over a long period and reduce recurrences.3. For symptom control, I would suggest you to take combination of montelukast + levocetirizine. If you have wheezing/bronchial symptoms, I would also add albuterol to your treatment.4. Regular nasal saline washes, steam inhalation and warm saline gargles will also help you in a long run.5. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. If stress is an important factor for you, regular relaxation and meditation will also help by reducing stress. Stress is an important trigger for allergies.

It's possible that you have an internal knee injury of the menisci or the main ligaments. If there is no bony injury then an MRI of the knee is to be done and this will reveal any soft tissue injury.Meanwhile, use a pressure bandage, apply ice packs, and you may pain medications like Broken or Diclofenac. Use a can or crutch to avoid too much pressure loading while walking. Hope you find this useful and wish you a speedy recovery"}

Just feel bad...slight nausea, been drinking gatoraide in case I was dehydrated - shouldnt be... very fatigued, had to come home and put on soft clothes, couldnt finish the day.", "output": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and understand your concern. But you should not worry I think It's nothing serious. As you describe, my opinion is that we are dealing with a rhythm issue. Someone can feel strong heart beats and palpitations for different reasons. It might be what we call ekstrasystoles.These is electrical heart impulses that generates in some parts of heart different from normal sinus rhythm. This generates that escaped beat. You have this sensation like a beat is skipping, you may experience palpitations or an anxiety sensation, difficulties in taking a deep breath. This extrasystoles may happen from different reasons from simple emotional stress to other pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism etc. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examinations like a blood analysis to exclude anemia, the thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder monitoring. This will help us to document and see what happens with heart rhythm. At meantime, I will recommend you to avoid coffee, caffeine products because they rise extrasistolic beats. This is nothing urgent or to worry abut, but I will recommend the examinations if the symptoms interfere your normal healthy live. Wish I was helpful. Take good care. Best regards"}

History of Panniculectomy, lip, regaining weight, exercises, bulimic behavior and now pain in abdomen over the last 2 days in the lower abdomen noted.

I can understand that you are very distressed due to your bed wetting problem. Now, bed wetting can be due to different factors - like stress, genetic factors, bladder problems, neurological problems, etc. In your case, you have mentioned that you have been going through a stressful time recently, and it is likely that this is a major cause for your bed wetting. So, I would suggest that you avoid stress and try practicing relaxation techniques to avoid anxiety and stress. There are medication like Desmopressin, Migraine, etc. which can improve bladder control and prevent bed wetting. So, I would suggest that you consult a urologist for a detailed evaluation and further treatment."}

According to doctor my one tube is patient but till i dont conceive.so what you suggest us for conceiving", "output": "Hello and thanks for the query, Since you have already attempted pregnancy for 5 years, I assume that husbands semen analysis has been done and is normal. I also assume that endometriosis and endometrial tuberculosis have been ruled out by histopathology and culture tests after laparoscopy. If this has not been done, it needs to be ruled out as if a tube is blocked there was most likely a tubal infection sometime and a concomitant endometrial pathology may be present. If the above reports are normal then you may go for an ovulation study and if the ovary on side of the open tube is ovulating, get an Intrauterine insemination [GUI] in that cycle. Sometimes there is problem with ascent of sperm inside the cervix to the tube, so GUI helps in such cases. If there is still no luck either a tuboplasty procedure to open the blocked tube may be done. Hope this helped. Best of luck, and I am sure you will conceive. A few more efforts and a positive attitude will help. Thanks for using Chat Doctor, have a good day. ChatDoctor BagdeConsultant obstetrics and gynecology."}

The brain injury must have somehow caused your brain to act and reduce blood flow to the periphery. Also, since you might have had internal bleeding this might be the cause.

If your symptoms are present for more than two years with no signs of aggressiveness and spreading then it is unlikely to be a cancer.

My assumption is that before the polypectomy, your cycles were irregular, or you were having irregular bleeding.  A D&C is limited in terms of its ability to completely remove polyps that might be present.

This would include labs to check for thyroid dysfunction, prolactin levels, diabetes screening, labs related to PCs, and an ultrasound called a sonohysterogram.

I seem to have trouble getting to talk with my doctor he seems that he s to busy to sit me down and give me details. YYYY@YYYY most respectfully gene harriman", "output": "Hi!welcome to Chat Doctor! For early stage or superficial bladder cancers, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBO), is the most common treatment. This surgery is done through an instrument passed up the urethra, The side effects of transurethral bladder surgery are generally mild and do not usually last long. Unfortunately, even with successful treatment, bladder cancer often recurs (comes back) in other parts of the bladder. If transurethral resection needs to be repeated many times, the bladder can become Weak, scarred and lose its capacity to hold much urine. This can be the reason in your case too. You must discuss with your treating urologist clearly. Hope this helps!"}

The pain in the lower front teeth can be because of the chronic localized periodontitis, that is nothing but the gum infection secondary to deposits or poor oral hygiene. Consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. If I am your treating doctor I would have put you on tablet doxycycline 100\u00a0mg, twice daily on first day and once daily on next 4 days(if you are not allergic). Then I would have advised scaling and root planing of the teeth. I hope my answer will help you, take care."}

He had a test (some sort of MRI) to check his pancreas due to lesions believed to be from prior pancreatitis and they found a cortical cyst on the right kidney.  Is there a possibility it could also be cancerous or should it not be a concern?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Yes, cortical renal cyst can be a precancerous lesion for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). But it is not 100% true. If patient is smoker or having prolonged chemical exposure than chances are high. And detailed examination of cyst is needed to stamp it as pre malignant lesion. Like its border, shape, content, association with renal structures etc. all are important.  And most important is biopsy. At the time of pancreatitis your radiologist might miss these things. So renal cortical cyst can present as pre malignant lesion for RCC and can develop in RCC if risk factors are present like smoking."}

I passed carefully through your question and would explain that single spikes of blood pressure are not indicative of uncontrolled high blood pressure. They could be related to physical activity or emotional stress. Coming to this point, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure frequently during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your GP. If your blood pressure values are frequently high, making some changes to your therapy may be needed. I would also recommend performing some tests to investigate for secondary causes of high blood pressure: -a chest X-ray study-complete blood count-kidney and liver function tests-fasting glucose-blood electrolytes- PCR, ESR for inflammation- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- cortisol and aldosterone for a Chat Doctor.  You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Meanwhile, I would recommend some lifestyle changes to help maintain a normal blood pressure naturally: - reduce salt and caffeine intake-perform regularly physical activity (walking, aerobics, etc.)- try to lose some pounds if you are overweight. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, "}

I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that the black pockets that are appearing in the area of the eruption of the second molar tooth of your toddler seems to be most probably an Eruption Hematoma or an Eruption cyst that occurs as a fluid filled pale to bluish black colored lump, and it is not a harmful condition and will resolve as the tooth will erupt. But in case if there is any problem associated with it or the tooth gets delay in erupting then it has to be removed to let the tooth erupt in the mouth and once the tooth erupts there is no further problem associated with it.

A CT Paranasal sinuses will help in determining the extent of the sinus problem. Nasal steroid sprays with the correct technique (use) will help along with long acting antihistamines.

I see a surgeon next week just preparing myself", "output": "I read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. Unfortunately fusion while it may improve the symptoms on that level doesn't help with other levels, it can even accelerate their damage because the reduced mobility in L5-S1 after the fusion adds the strain on L4-L5. Hence, it is not to be surprised to have protrusion on L4-L5 with displacement of L5 root. It does justify your symptoms, although to be sure about that an exam is needed (reflexes, muscle weakness, numbness location) to confirm symptoms correspond to that root and not to remains of old problem.

My husband is having xray yesterday for his 1 of requirments.. the result of the xray was this Pulmonary Koch s Infection. minimal infiltrate in the left upper lobe with at 1.7 cavity. i just wanted to understand whats the meaning of this because he has a previous illness before about tuberculosis..also known as TB.plz i really need the answer.", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Your husband s current x-ray report says he is having cavity with fresh infiltration.  These mean active TB infection. Cavitory lesion on chest x-ray has high chances of having active, infectious TB. If he has previous TB than this can be a healed lesion. But for this you need1. CT THORAX2. Bronchoscopy and BAD (Bronchi Alveolar Lavage) analysis for TB. CT THORAX gives excellent visualization of lung parenchymal and much better imaging modality than chest x-ray. So if both are negative for TB than this is probably due to past tb infection."}

He says that when he gets angry it is mainly because of people who have bad ethics , otherwise he would have no reason to get so angry. My boyfriend is not a regular bully, he is a highly-educated professional who just has problems controlling his anger. However, he should take a good look at himself when he is angry. His face is beetroot red and his eyes dart around and he screams as loud as a volcano erupting. He won t let the matter rest until I talk him out slowly. When I am out with him, he gets jealous and glares menacingly at any men who looks my way for more than a second. I will tell him to stop but he continues. Only when I threaten to walk away will he stop his nonsense. But of course, a few days later, his bad attitude and anger management issues start again. I have known him for 5 months.

He plays squash (which many think of as a violent game) and is an otherwise active and healthy 39 year old (I am 24).

If your boyfriends anger irritability and poor frustration tolerance has been of recent onset, then underlying psychological problems like stress, anxiety or depression have to be considered.

If you feel that his anger problem is prominent and causing interpersonal or social difficulties, I would advise you to ask him to get professional help. There are various good psychological therapies and counselling techniques which can help with such problems. Also practicing relaxation techniques, learning stress-management and coping skills will also be beneficial. Wish you all the best."}

While cleansing is an important step in those who have oily face, it should be gentle and not harsh; it should not over Chat Doctor. I usually ask my patients to use either a salicylic acid based cleanser Or take a few sessions of salicylic acid peel. Salicylic acid inhibits oil production and deep cleanses pores. Another alternative is to start patients on a low dose of Oral Retinoids e.g. Isotretinoin. Retinoids are hemostatic; reduce the size of sebaceous glands and in turn reduces sebum production.

In January of 2013, I tripped over my laptop cord and went flying into our dining room table that has a sharp edge and broke my nose. It happened so quickly that I don t know how I also managed to hit the back upper side of my head (maybe on one of the chairs?), nearly broke my left knee and suffered bruising on my right arm, hip and thigh. I didn t go to the ER because when I called them, they said I would be waiting for hours and the waiting room was full of flu patients. The cut across my nose was pretty clean, not gaping. My husband helped get the bleeding stopped. I did look as though I had been beaten severely the next day with major black eyes and bruising in the other areas. I was surprised at how sore the back of my head was since there wasn t even a slight bump. I didn t think much about it as I gradually improved. On July 1 of 2013 my husband and I flew to Wisconsin from Texas and then back again after 6 days. Upon arriving in WI, I started having terrible headaches and confusion. Within 4 days of returning to Texas, my husband had to take me to the ER because the headache pain was unbearable and sudden very high blood pressure. The ER got me stable with BP meds, fluids and 3 doses of morphine. I don t remember any of that. My husband said I kept trying to pull the IV s out. I saw my PCP the next day and he sent me for an MRI which showed I had a subdural hematoma with a thin layer of blood covering my entire brain. I had been taking lots of advil and aspirin for the pain.The neurosurgeon I was referred to said DO NOT take either because of the bleed. He decided not to do surgery but put me on Keppra to reduce the chances of seizures and have follow up CT scans and visits to see him. My PCP put me on Lisinipril for the BP before I saw the NS. I ve had 2 catscans since the MRI and they show improvement. But I m still having periods of confusion, occasional but not constant high BP (I have always had low BP) and mild headaches. I am now off of the Keppra but am taking 1/2 of a 2.5 Lisiniprol when the BP goes up. I am also more depressed than usual (I have fibromylagia, hypothyroidism, and IBS).

Understand that the skull is a closed space in which the brain is placed. So any added matter in a closed space will increase the pressure. That is a basic law of physics.

The physical therapist will assess and teach you exercises for the strengthening of your back and once you continue the exercises for about 3 months you'll have a strong back. If your pain at the moment is just in the lower back region and that to maximum on sitting then you can simply apply some heat and take muscle relaxants for 3-5 days and start with a few exercises. That should help relieve your pain. The exercises include1. Bridging2. Knee to Chest3. Straight leg raise to 30 degrees on both legs4. Static abdominals5. Hip abduction and extension6.

He saidi was breathing really deep/fast andhe thought i was going to pass out. I didnt notice because im usually like that when i exercise (bball,skateboarding,biking). depending on how long/hard i exercise ill get a tight chest so its kinda harder to breathe (sometimes if i just push myself harder my chest will burn) and end up feeling congested and ill be coughing a lot. I always thought it was normal, but my friend asked if i had asthma...and so i looked stuff up and found out about EIA. Im wondering if i should go to a doctor, cus i have some people telling me im just out of shape...but i dunno cus i rememeber coughing a lot during exercise for the last two years or so. Its a deep harsh cough from the chest.  One person told me i might have just normal asthma. I never had allergies before but in the last year or so i have noticed that especially in the summer ill have what feels like sinus problems...just a feeling of pressure around my nose/eyes and a headache. I never used to get headaches much before either. I dunno if im imagining things now cus im wondering wat my symptoms are, but it feels like im either getting sick (cus my sister had a cold recently) or something else..cus my chest feels a little tight, ive got that sort of sinus pressure feeling and a little bit of a headache...Does coughing/getting congested from laughing have anything to do with asthma? cus i dont even have to laugh hard to get that.

I went through your history and would like to know more about you like your age, nose symptoms, weight, height, family history, etc. etc. However, from your provided details, at present I would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Yes, bouts of coughing and breathing difficulty/fast breathing/wheezing (whistle like sound from chest) while exercise and laughing suggest asthma. Asthma is a very broad diagnosis, it can be due to allergies or other non-allergic reasons to. Sinusitis (a sinus disorder) and obesity also worsen asthma symptoms.2. As you have above symptoms and also sinus problems, I would suggest you to consult a doctor who may suggest you investigations for diagnosis of asthma and allergies also.3. I usually suggest my such patients' spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing and post-exercise testing to diagnose/rule out asthma. 4. Sometimes exercise related breathing issues can also be non-asthmatic, so it is important that you see a doctor and get diagnosed by him/her.5. If you are obese, weight reduction will also improve your symptoms to some extent.6. Control of sinus symptoms with antihistamines (cetirizine or levocetirizine or fexofenadine etc.) and regular steam inhalation will also gradually improve you symptoms.7. Regular physical exercise including breathing exercise and healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals will gradually improve your lung capacity and immunity respectively in a long run.8. Please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.9. For breathing difficulty/wheezing/asthma symptoms, your doctor suggest you to use albuterol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis or inhaled corticosteroids on regular basis depending upon your spirometry report and detailed examination. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health ahead. Thank you & Regards."}

People may emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need special attention. Recovery usually occurs gradually, with patients acquiring more and more ability to respond. Some patients never progress beyond very basic responses, but many recover full awareness. Patients recovering from coma require close medical supervision. A coma rarely lasts more than 2 to 4 weeks. Some patients may regain a degree of awareness after vegetative state. Others may remain in a vegetative state for years or even decades. The most common cause of death for a person in a vegetative state is infection such as pneumonia.

These suggest a low blood perfusion in the body like in certain conditions of the heart. Your friend is quite ill, and I would recommend that you take her to the ER.

Wisdom tooth removal is a little more complicated compared to other teeth due to its angulation and proximity to nerve. The tingling and numbness which you are experiencing in tongue and gums can be due to minor pricking of the nerve during procedure. This usually takes 3-4 weeks to heal up or can be longer.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology. I suppose in your case we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life longs you are diabetic, and you have cholesterol problems under treatment we have blood pressure target for you bellow 120/80 mmHg. Diabetes and lipid disorders are cardiovascular risk factors, so we have to be much aggressive with our mean blood pressure values. It is normal to have blood pressure values above 140/80 mmHg soon after walking and fast heart beats. It is mandatory to have lower mean values during the day. Physical activity, losing weight and diet will help you to better control high pressure, diabetes and lipid disorder but this doesn't mean that you will stop your medications. Hypertension and diabetes will be treated medically livelong. Keeping on with your diet will help you to stay on lower dosage of medication as long as possible, but you should never stop your blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes medicine. Stopping them will rise all your values again because these are chronic disease. So, my opinion is to keep on with your physical activity and diet, continue your medicine and after two months discus with your doctors for your medicine dosage after measuring once a wile your blood pressure and your diabetes. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards."}

Having known this basic anatomy, you must avoid any activity that aggravates the condition, like bending forward and lifting heavy objects, sitting long hours on computer, inappropriate sitting posture, etc. The medications will relieve pain and help muscles to relax. Physiotherapy shall also help a lot, especially exercises that strengthen your back. Kindly note that exercises only be done when it doesn't hurt. Adequate rest and proper nutrition is equally important.  Chat Doctor. "}

Are these indeed freckles or are they something else ie a rash, broken vessels...?", "output": "Hi there, The most common cause of the feeling of pins and needles after liver transplant is neuropathy, which can be secondary to your transplant medications. I'm not sure what is causing your freckles. Usually, immunosuppressive medications for your transplant can cause you to be more at risk for skin cancers, but 7 weeks out is a little soon. This sounds more like a rash, and I'd try some Ben Chat Doctor.  I'd makes sure that you follow up with your transplant surgeon as soon as you can, and let him know about this.  In general, transplant patients should also see a dermatologist regularly, as they are at very high risk for skin cancers, and should have all their regular cancer screening when scheduled. Your transplant surgeon should be very invested in your success here, so I'm sure he or she will be happy to help you. I hope this answers your question.

As you had a history of past fall, and ligament injury, this could be the same as per my understanding. Having a thorough clinical musculoskeletal examination followed by an MRI of the knee will help understand the soft tissues better. Also, your age is 80, so some degenerative changes in the joint can be expected on general physiology. Having a physical therapy for a few sessions should help reduce the pain and improve the mobility as well. With therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy the pain will be reduced and inflammation as well. Performing some simple knee strengthening exercises will help stabilize the joint and safeguard it from future injuries. In my clinical practice most geriatric cases respond well to physical therapy.

Dark eye circles (usually due to melanin pigmentation) may be associated with cholangitis disturbing the liver functions.ERCP itself can produce some amount of inflammation around the area in duodenum and some time pancreatitis.

And if I have it what is the treatment?", "output": "Dear Sir, Hi & Welcome to Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern for the given lab tests. The IGM Antibody level is suggestive of infection, but it may not be due to Tuberculosis in your case. This may be due to common respiratory tract infection for which you were prescribed the antibiotic Literal and you seem to have recovered from it. However, if you still suspect it to be due to tuberculosis then you are advised to undergo certain lab tests to confirm the TB infection like:1) Sputum for Acid Fast Bacilli staining (at least for 3 days) 2) Chest (X-Ray) 3) ESR examination. If these lab tests suggest tuberculous infection in that case you will have to take a course of anti TB medication for at least 6-9 months duration. Hope I could answer your query.

To avoid more compression the body had taken the new position of the spinal column leading to scoliosis.

I can say this is functional scoliosis and needs a correction to avoid more trouble to the intervertebral disc. The first thing to do is meeting up an orthopedist to get it physically examined, and also an MRI will be advised. Later taking medication for pain will be recommended.

I have a 20month of little girl, who goes in or dental surgery on the 19th of this month. She was a premiee, born at 36wks, weighing in at 5lbs 4oz. A very healthy little girl. Her name is Eleni. As I said, she is 20mos old. She didnt start to get teeth until about 8mos. She started off with just the 2 bottom teeth until about14mos. Then all the sudden was getting two at a time. About 2months ago we noticed some brown spots on her two upper front teeth. Within about 1 to 2wks of this discovery, a piece of one of the teeth had broke off(the enamel).  We took her to a pedatric specialist, who said that he would try his best to cap the teeth, but, it he wasnt able to he would haveto pull them out. She will be having this procedure done at franklin square hospital in Marylad. They will be putting her under general anestesia. I have two other children 9 & 10, neither have ever even had a cavity. Now my eleni has 3. The doctor never gave us any reasoning on why his was happening. She is a good brusher, even at this young age. Eleni is very smart & loves to brush her eeth.

Thank you fr your time!!Very concerned mom, Amanda.", "output": "Hello:) Welcome to Chat Doctor. It is safe and common for a child to be on general anesthesia as they generally do not cooperate with the procedures. Do not panic. Eruption of milk teeth at age of 6 months is common, at times they get it at 8 months. This is not abnormal. You must discuss with your dentist why these cavities/brown spots appeared on her teeth. Discuss with your hygienist about preventive measures. This will also help you prevent cavities in the future. Comfort your child regarding the procedure. Prepare her with a positive attitude. Do not stress yourself or scare her. Check the levels of fluoride in your Chat Doctor. Higher fluoride can make her teeth brown. Gargle after every meal. She must brush before bed, never sleep off while having milk/sugar syrups etc. Hope this helps."}

I would advise you to get the barium study for the colon and intestines in real time (with fluoroscopy) to see the motility problems. Colonoscopy can not find the motility disorders. Also go for CT scan of the abdomen: this is to find any other problem with the other structures like lymph nodes and so. This time too antibiotics can definitely help and start under the care of a Gastroenterologist.

There are some possibilities of your problem.Long-standing tiredness after thyroidectomy may be due to hypothyroidism. The levothyroxine dose you are taking probably is not sufficient. Simply t4 & TSH test will guide you about the dose. Next the pain you're feeling at various part of the body particularly the low back pain should be concerned. It may be simple mechanical pain. But the disease recurrence & bony metastasis should also be considered. Nuclear scanning of the whole body have to be done. Please contact with your concerned doctor. Take care."}

Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I carefully read your query. As I am let to understand, coronary angiogram was performed. Well, there are different strategies on treating a narrowed or totally blocked coronary artery. It would be really helpful to see the full report and the film. However, I am going to try to ad Chat Doctor.  First, there is angioplasty and stenting of the artery. If the time from onset of a severe, different from others, episode of chest pain to angioplasty is less than six hours, then the benefits on the heart muscle is the highest. I am, of course, referring to a totally closed coronary artery which caused an acute myocardial infarction. If there is a significant blockage to the main artery, and I am assuming that this is the left main coronary artery or the very beginning of the left anterior descendant artery, then the strategy of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) provides more benefit in aspects of lifespan and symptom ameliorating. If this is a blockage in the proximal or midden portion of the LAD artery, then angioplasty and stent placement would be the appropriate strategy, with safety and effectiveness. "}

IQ below 60 is considered mentally retarded (Intellectual disability). As your child psychiatrist diagnosed him as MR (Intellectual disability), that could be surely it. Mental retardation (MR) is a condition diagnosed before age 18, usually in infancy or prior to birth, that includes below-average general intellectual function, and a lack of the skills necessary for daily living. The causes could be Genetic conditions, problems during pregnancy, Exposure to certain types of disease or toxins, problems at birth like not enough oxygen, Iodine deficiency, malnutrition etc. Intellectual disability is more accurately considered a disability rather than a disease. No treatments are available specifically for cognitive deficiency. Although the pharmacologic enhancement of cognition is possible. I request you not to get alarmed. There are many treatment options a DN management options. You should work with the child psychiatrist. You may have to take the help of counselor, psychotherapist, speech therapist and occupational therapist. Most of all, your motivated positive approach is going to be the key. Your child needs your love and care. Love him and care him. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

Could you give me some idea of what my treatment options would be. At L3-L4, a tiny circumferential disc bulge is present which, in conjunction with mild facet arthropathy, contributes to mild right-sided and minimal left-sided neural foramen narrowing. At L4-L5, a tiny circumferential disc bulge is present which, in conjunction with mild to moderate bilateral facet arthropathy contributes to mild right and minimal left neural foramen narrowing. Central canal is patent. At L5-S1, a tiny circumferential disc bulge is present secondary to severe disc base height loss. Mild to moderate facet arthropathy is present. These findings contribute to mild bilateral neural foramen narrowing. IMPRESSION:Multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar spine with multilevel neural foramen narrowing but without severe central canal stenosis as described above.", "output": "Hi, treatment options should bring a holistic approach to the issue. Diet and weight loss are essential for reducing the pressure on the discs and nerves. Strengthening the back muscles can help too. Medically conservative therapy like NSAIDs is essential not only in pain reduction but also in reducing edema around the bulging discs due to chronic inflammatory state, which will release some pressure over the nerves. Your last resort is surgery and should be the last resort only if all above failed, and you develop severe neurological problems."}

My hip is feeling better every day but am still troubled by back pain. When I asked the Ortho Surgeon if I could use the tens machine post operation he shook his head and said better not to.

The pain got much better but after a week out of the boot, the pain has returned and I have lots of swelling in the ankle and foot. What could this be? What is my next course of action?", "output": "You need to meet the same doctor, or you may even visit a physical therapist who can help u guide some exercise. Try doing exercise for calf muscles and feet. For calf muscles you can do ankle toe movements and for feet you can pick some small marbles off the floor with the toes. Do use contrast bath technique as it'll help ease the swelling. Elevate the feet above the level of heart and the swelling will come down. The venous return is always a bigger issue in swelling or DVT. Please follow proper exercise for the lower limbs and I can say your problem is almost solved."}

There is no need to put any artificial tooth in to that space, it is very difficult to clean that area also, assess of toothbrush is very difficult in that area. Because of lack of space in jaw during development, there will be no space left for wisdom tooth that is why problems occur with wisdom tooth.

Oral surgeon will manage extraction under antibiotic, analgesic, trypsin,chymotrypsin, b-complex and antiseptic mouthwash coverage.

Thank you for your question. In my opinion you have nothing to worry about it. The headache you have is caused by the contracted muscles of the scalp due to hair traction by the band in this case. It may be also aggravated by a wrong position of your head (during staying or writing, working at the computer), from psychological stress, etc. Dizziness is another feature of this kind of headache (Tension type Headache). Nothing is going to happen to your brain if you continue holding the band. Your brain is well protected! We have seen in patient who underwent brain surgery, that the bands very straight to the head can cause damage to skin in the pressure point, but it is not your case. Your band is not so tight, also you don't have it on during night. You may just make pauses (remove it) remove it during the day, so your muscles get a little relaxed. You will get pain relief.

In case of disc disease, surgery or conservative treatment decision is made based upon multiple factors. MRI findings are correlated with clinical profile of patient, patients dedication to follow precautions before and after surgery, physiotherapy. Now in your case, I will give you some knowledge and insight of disc disease. Based on that you may be benefited regarding management of your disc problem. As you have disc bulge at three level, it might be due to your age (if it is more than 60 years, chances of disc bulge is unto 35-40%), your occupation (heavy weight lifting or keeping spine in flexed position for long duration). Now if you are less than 60 years, active, having no other illness, then you should consult doctor and get your neurological examination done. The doctor will examine your pain site, any radiation of pain from back to posterior part of lower limb. It is due to nerve compression from disc. Doctor will evaluate your urine, bowel and sexual function for any deficit. He/she will examine you for sensory loss in L4/L5/S1 territory which is your front aspect of leg and plantar aspect of your foot. After that, your lower limb power will be checked. If there is any deficit, then it will be correlated with MRI findings. It is known as Clincio-radiological correlation. Based on it, you will be advised painkillers like pregabalin/Gabapentin, nerve vitamins like B12, folic acid and/or surgery. If you are >60 years, bedridden, having morbid illness like heart disease and not active, then you will be advised medical management most probably. Usually, disc surgery is advised in case of focal deficit caused by nerve compression from disc, acute disc with focal deficit, no relief in articular pain even after full dose of painkillers after 6 weeks of therapy, disc herniation with unstable spine and patient is fit to undergo surgery and follow post-operative advise. You are having diffuse disc bulge at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1 which is usually not treated by surgery. Mostly, disc extrusion or migration are managed by surgery. But final decision can only be made after complete clinical evaluation. Meanwhile, you should avoid weight lifting, avoid forward flexion, travelling long distance, prolonged sitting. Thanks.

The renal pelvis is the area where the upper end of ureter, tube connecting kidney and urinary bladder starts. In the absence of stones or any infection of kidneys it is unlikely that the prominent renal pelvis is a matter of concern. It is mildly prominent and clearly mentioned no hydronephrosis. It is still possible that an infection can move from urinary bladder to kidneys and cause prominence of the kidney pelvis on both sides. This can be confirmed only if there is significant bacterial growth in your urine and if the bladder is also showing signs of infection and cystitis on ultrasound scan.

Veins are the blood tubes that carry deoxygenated blood from various parts of our body to heart and lungs. If these veins become abnormally thick, twisted or tortuous, they are called varicose veins. Usually these happen in elderly people, but if there is some abnormality in the vein wall, you are obese, your routine requires you to stand for very long periods of time then younger people like you may suffer from it, too. To get relief from this, you need to wear compression stockings that are available in medical stores. Do lots of exercise. Elevate your legs while sleeping and if possible, when you are sitting. Try to avoid continuous standing periods. If you do not find relief in symptoms or then worsen, you should see a physician for physical examination. I hope this information helps.

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. Most of the childhood asthma improve with age and subside by 7-8 years as told by your doctor. However, exact age at which the child will be alright cannot be told and of course, some child Chat Doctor. So if your sons' asthma has improved over years (that is, he is having fewer attacks of asthma than he used to have before, or he is requiring fewer doses of inhaler medicines that he used to require before), I would not worry. However, if his asthma has not improved as suggested above, I would think he may have an allergic asthma which continues into adolescent and adult age. In such case I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will after detailed history taking suggest your son allergy testing, which is necessary to know what he is allergic to. Breathing exercises & avoidance of amoke-dust-air pollution will help him a lot improve his asthma. Regarding stammering, it is a speech disorder and is not directly related to asthma. However, psychological issues such as low self-esteem (which may be due to having asthma) can contribute to stammering. I would suggest you to stay positive towards him, encourage him and get a help from a speech therapist who will suggest some speech exercises for stammering. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish your son the best of the health. Regards."}

However, it might have been advised so because many would experience severe hair fall during or after the period of illness and its treatment, which may be bothersome.

Thank you for the query. Skull is so hard that any brain tumor does not grow outside and can not be palpated as a lump. Moreover, brain tumor would not be tender when touching it. So the lump he has found is most likely some skin lump which has gotten infected. Nausea can be a symptom of brain tumor.

You feel that people are thinking that you are looking at their breasts. Even with family members you have such problem and this thing is causing loss of confidence. Most probably your complaints are occurring due to Social anxiety disorder and this has reached to obsessional level. You have started thinking that you should not look into the breasts and due to this you continuously look in individuals eyes. You become conscious due to that and this has resulted in social impairment. I would advise you to consult a Psychiatrist for that. Behavior therapy will help in decreasing the undesired behavior. Medicines like high dose Escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine etc. are commonly used to decrease anxiety. For symptomatic relief low dose benzodiazepines or propranolol can be used.

What should I do and how long should I wait to take my medications that are contraindicated with lactulose. Thank You, Sincerely, Harry Hoskins", "output": "Hi, thank you for Providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical Neuromuscular assessment is advised along with MRI of spine. As you have degenerative disc disease and also on medication, then to make you understand and help better there is a limitation of the medicine for symptomatic relief. The degenerative disc disease occurs dude to weakness of the spinal muscles which allows the spinal column to reduce in size and then later provides compression on the disc and the pinching of the nerve roots. Usually in my clinical practice such cases with degenerative disc disease are recommended with physical therapy as to get the maximum outcome and reduce the medication. As medicine over a longer run are not good for the kidneys and may lead to damage. Physical therapy like - Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy are useful to control the pain without any side effects and also exercises on a later stage provide the maximum outcome score of Strength of the muscular system. Also, TENS works even better when you are under medication for a shorter time.regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "}

Steroids go off the system fairly quickly (less than a week), and in any case you - the woman - have not been on any of these medications. Imuran takes much longer to get off the system, but this should not be stopped as it is a great medication to keep the Ulcerative colitis under control, and should not give any problems in terms of achieving pregnancy.

I understand your concern. Rubella (German measles) is a contagious viral infection. It is a significant health risk for pregnant women. If a pregnant woman is infected with rubella, especially in the first trimester, it may lead to miscarriage or the fetus may suffer severe birth defects. Once a person is infected with rubella, a person would have lifelong immunity. You can infect others from 10 days before the rash appears until about 2 weeks after it disappears. Like most other viral infections, there is no cure for rubella. It is a self limiting disease, and you need to wait for the period to go away. No treatment will shorten the course of rubella infection. Symptoms are so mild that treatment is usually not necessary. You need to take supportive treatment like analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen for fever and headache.

The doctors told me it was typhoid fever. I was tested, and I responded positively to SALMONELLA O, TYPE Vi POSITIVE A with somatic(O) antigens. My question is, how do I know for sure that I did have Typhoid fever (and that the positive test wasnt the result of my earlier vaccination)? Wasnt my vaccination supposed to prevent the Typhoid? What are the chances someone can get Typhoid even though they were vaccinated? Does this mean I can get typhoid fever again (do I need to be vaccinated again?)", "output": "Hello,first, the vaccine does not confer 100% protection, so getting sick cannot be excluded. The diagnosis of typhoid fever is not based on a positive H and O because this test is considered obsolete. And the reason is that a patient may have other pathogens that cross-react and give positive results, so an over diagnosis of typhoid fever would occur if we relied on this test only. The most accurate way to establish the diagnosis is by culturing the organism. Stool cultures is the most feasible strategy, but bone marrow specimen can be used as well. The vaccine efficacy is not very well studied, but it can be about 70%. It declines rapidly with time. Three years after vaccination It's supposed to be lower than 50%. If this was typhoid fever indeed then this acts as a booster for your immune system. So if you're going to travel again in the future then perhaps you should receive vaccination again, particularly if more than a couple of years have passed since the last vaccination. Kind Regards!"}

Numbness to the chin and lower lip, as in your case, is attributable to many causes including bone infection, bone tumor/ cancer, trauma.

When this fibrosis occurs innings, it causes contraction of the area leading to stretching of the vessels along with the nerves supplying it, this is thought to be the reason for pain.

Poor endometrial perfusion is the leading cause. Tuberculosis and endometrial pathologies should be ruled out. You can try taking sildanefil or estrogen tablets after consultation with your doctor. Letoval is not to be continued after the 8th day. Duphaston is routinely given as luteal phase support.

Could something be wrong with them?", "output": "HiT hank you for your question to Chat Doctor. Pain in the lower back on either side can come from multiple reasons that lead to para spinal muscle spasm or from inner organs. Pain related to kidneys is usually felt in the subcostal angle which is just below the rib cage and on one side of the midline in back. A tenderness elicited by pressing deep in this region would indicate kidneys as a likely cause. In your case it would be helpful to know your age, how long the pain has been there, was there any inciting event that started this pain and are there any related symptoms like fever or any urinary symptoms. I would recommend if the pain persists for a long time or symptoms worsen, you will need to see a doctor to find out the cause of your pain. Hope this is helpful.

However, what you are suffering from may be angina which is a risk factor for a heart attack. It is unlikely that you have sustained a heart attack, but you are at the risk of having one. That's why I suggest you to get a cardiac evaluation. Please do an ECG, 2d echo. ECG will show the hearts electrical activity and changes of angina. 2 d echo will show the pumping function of the heart, the structure of heart muscles, its valves and leak between the valves if present. This will give an indication whether you have already sustained a heart attack.

I have for awhile now have gotten chest pains on my left side. They come and go throughout the day lasting only a few seconds.I feel short of breath occasionally. Never cough (unless I have a cold). Sometimes my heart beats fast and I get dizzy when I stand I have had 4 migranes within the last month always with aura. I have smoked since I was about 15. Average 1/2 pack a day. I recently had EKG, Chest x-ray, blood work. All came back normal. But I am worried I have a heart disease or lung cancer. These are the only symptoms. I have had three children (2011, 2012, 2014) all healthy normal pregnancies. No other known health problems. Have generalized anxiety and bi-polar. Should I ask my dr about lung cancer because I smoke?", "output": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis as it is common in smokers and cause similar symptoms. So get done PFT. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators too. And quit smoking as soon as possible as it will only harm you. If PFT is normal than mostly you are having anxiety only, because other investigations (blood report, chest x-ray and ECG) are normal. So better to avoid stress and anxiety. Be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and try to discuss all your symptoms."}

He has got cough and flem, we visited a paediatrician and he had prescribed for ventolim 1.5ml 3 times a day. But our Australian paediatrician has us not to take ventolin until 6months old. What is the best medication at this stage", "output": "Hi dear, If he does not have fever or breathing difficulty, this probably indicates a viral respiratory infection. Ventolin contains albuterol/albuterol, a bronchodilator that will reduce cough if there is wheezing in chest. Wheezing in infants is better treated by nebulization, but this may not be feasible during a trip. Although Ventolin can be safely given to 3\u00a0m old baby in time of need, levosalbutamol will be more apt. You can give syrup Leveling(levosalbutamol 1\u00a0mg/5ml) 1.5ml 3 times a day. If the cough is not disturbing, and he is active and playful, cough will subside without any medicines in 3-5 days.

I recently had a lot of dental work done .", "output": "Hi. Can understand your concern. As per your complaint pain in jaw that radiates to temple can be most commonly due to dental infection. As you have recently undergone dental treatment any recurrence of infection in any of the tooth can lead to pain that can radiate to the temple as well as the entire jaw on the same side. It can also be due to inflammation in the gum flap above the erupting or impacted wisdom tooth due to deposition of food debris between the tooth and the gum flap leading to inflammation of the gum flap and the symptoms you explained can be apparent in case of inflamed gum flap. Ulcers can be canker sores or traumatic ulcers caused due to trauma to the mucosa during dental treatment. In case of pain in the sores you can apply numbing gels like McCoppin or Or abase gel for relief. I would suggest you to consult a dental surgeon and get evaluated clinically so that proper check up including x-ray where ever required can be done to find out the exact cause of the pain.

What could this be caused from? Is it treatable? Is it a serious condition to be concerned about?", "output": "Hello, I went through your query. The swelling under your neck is maybe either a swollen lymph node or a swollen salivary gland. The lymph nodes below the jaws will get enlarged as a reaction to any local infection like an infected tooth or gums. And the fact that is very painful, it is more indicative of an infection. Also there is a possibility that the swelling may not be a swollen lymph node. It can be a salivary gland whose duct may be blocked by a calculus(stone).

You haven't mentioned the exact duration and line of treatment you got for your illness. Probably you were suffering from dissociative amnesia. Dissociative disorder most probably occurs due to unresolved underlying conflicts which can be brought out by psychotherapy or hypnosis. This will also treat your symptoms and help you to tackle conflicts in more sound way. You need to consult a psychiatrist and yes, you can live totally normal life when your underlying cause is completely treated. You can plan family as soon as you completely cured.

Minute (mirtazapine), T. Paid (paroxetine), T. Que tan (Quetiapine) & T. LOCATED (Clonazepam); I would like to know your exact set of symptoms & sequence of addition of these medications. For your ongoing sleep problems, lets start from basic measures; 1. Try to sleep & get up at fixed times 2. If you don't feel sleepy within 20 minutes of going to bed, get out of bed & pace around, read a book, soothing music till you feel sleepy again & then go back to bed 3. Use bed only for sleeping & sleeping only!! 4. Avoid tea/coffee after 6pm 5. Avoid daytime naps 6. Do 30 minutes daily physical exercise including cardio, resistance training, yoga & Panama. If problem is only sleep; consult your Psychiatrist about medications like Agomelatine (adopted), Hamilton (Ramstein), Trazodone (Brazil) or optimizing T. Mirtazapine (Minute) alone & tapering off all other medications. You can get back to me for any further assistance. Good Luck"}

The tumor is in her left lung, she has pleural drain after fluid build-up in lining. Her doctor says there s nothing left to do, except a low dose chemo (which she s had treatment once a week over the last 3 weeks) with a 20-25% chance of slowing it down. The tumor is growing into the pulmonary artery & caused blood clots. She gives herself blood thinner shot 2X a day. Now she is bloated and tired. How much time does she have? I ve taken off work to care for her off & on the past year and a half. I don t know whether to take FMLA or just go help when I can. She s 2 1/2 hours away.", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should take FMLA. As your mother is progressing towards end stage malignancy. Lung cancer when spread in pulmonary artery and gives tumor thrombi, this suggests the worst prognosis.  Your mother soon develop massive pulmonary embolism (tumor thrombi) and pulmonary hypertension.  In fact she may start this as you are saying that she is puffed up. Lower limb edema is the earliest sign of pulmonary hypertension. So in my opinion you should take FMLA and spend as much time as you can with your mother as in my opinion she has less than 3 months of life expectancy."}

Increased heart rate & palpitations can have a lot of causes. It can be normal sinus tachycardia due to anxiety or stress, or it could be abnormal supra ventricular tachycardia. For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation & tachycardia. If the duration of palpitations are short enough to reach a nearby hospital, we put a 24hr ECG monitoring (Holder Monitor). You also need to do a 2D Echo & thyroid function test to see for any associated abnormality if any. Thanks"}

I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Acidity, heartburn, can cause or aggravate breathlessness or asthmatic symptoms. I would first think of HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) for you.2. I usually suggest my such patients an antacid like pantoprazole (which is there in Canton total) for 4-6 weeks regularly.3. Furthermore, I would also suggest you to avoid hot and spicy foods, caffeinated beverages, alcohol and smoking.4. If you have symptoms of breathlessness apart from acidity, I would suggest you spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing which helps to know your lung capacity and also to know whether you have asthma or any other lung disorder.5. If stress is an important factor for you, I would also suggest you regular relaxation and meditation.6.

I would like to tell you one thing about the treatment of allergy. The only effective treatment of Allergy is avoidance of allergen (Triggering factor). Any substance could be an allergen. Most common allergens for NASA bronchial allergy are dust and pollen. As far as the monteluKast is concerned - this is not useful in treating acute attack of allergy. It will help in reducing the frequency of allergic episodes. For it to be effective you might have to use it for years (2-3 Years). In very rare cases may have to be used for very long periods. Rota caps will give you instant relief but will not affect the recurrence of allergic episodes. The only definitive treatment as I have mentioned earlier is avoidance of allergen. Just list out all the possible allergens with which you experience allergy. Try to avoid those allergens. Try using a cloth mask while going out. Using newer antihistamines like Fexofenadine 120 mg (Allegra) will help you to counter acute attacks. Get your Blood Eosinophil count done. Based on the result. You can use some medicines like DEC (Di Ethyl carbamide) which reduces the eosinophils and will prevent recurrent attacks of nasobronchial allergy. But please discuss with your doctor before you start using DEC. Hope you got some solution. Wish you a healthy day Take care"}

Also getting checked by a dentist for the toothache will clear any doubt about the pathology of the oral cavity. For the disc degeneration in the C & C6 region I advise to take therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy which will alter the pain and spasm. Also performing regular strengthening exercises for the neck, upper limb and shoulder will help you ease of symptoms. Usually along with the medicine, physical therapy plays a good benefits. I have personal experience of cases with such symptoms and 99% of patients recover. I am hoping the same with you. As surgery is the last consideration made by the surgeon.

You are correct in your observation that the rash is caused by masturbating using the lotion. I suggest you to stop any sexual activity including physical sex as well as masturbation for at least few weeks of time to give some rest to the affected vaginal area. It will help you in healing of the inflamed mucosal skin of the vaginal walls. Do not try to apply any kind of lotions or creams for healing and during masturbation too as it can cause secondary bacterial infection as well as multiple other problems. Simply take paracetamol tablets with antihistamine tablet and maintain good hygiene and can do warm compression for early healing the best."}

I understand your query and concern. Congestive heart failure has poor prognosis in all cases if the ejection fraction is under 30%. The overall prognosis in your sons' case is marginal since Duchess muscular dystrophy leads to respiratory complications affecting the cardiac output.It's always advisable to keep the blood pressure under 130/80 mm of Hg. Avoid overt treatment to prevent lightheadedness, for this I advise you to have a baseline 2 dimensional echocardiography, ECG,HS CRP and lipid profile to assess the basic cardiac reserve of your heart. Restrict the intake of salt to less than 6gm/day. Chat Doctor. Reduce the intake of fatty and fried food. Oatmeal for breakfast 30-50 gm taken in milk daily will clear the accumulated fat.

Pain in ribs which is increasing in character is a matter of concern. It can be a contusion of skin and subcutaneous tissue which is causing you the pain. It can also be a minor hairline fracture in the ribs which is causing the pain(as you have mentioned cracking) and increasing pain.

Should I continue with icing or should I switch to warm compresses and/or massaging the area?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. You might have had a scalp swelling after your injury which caused the goose egg appearance. This can happen when there is slight injury and bleeding in to the skin. This injury is restricted to the scalp and does not cause any bleeding in the brain. If there is worsening pain, dizziness, vomiting and nausea, difficulty to maintain gait then a brain problem would have been thought of. Icing might not help much, and you can start warm compresses to feel better. Hematoma can occur under the scalp, but it usually maintains its size. Your injury does not look like hematoma.

I have no fever, nausea or pain if I move around or jump even. Could it be appendicitis still? Also I was doing some exercise and physical labor the other day; so could that mean a pulled muscle?", "output": "Hi. The symptoms of appendicitis are : Pain starts at the umbilical region and then shift to the right Iliad fossa; there may be nausea and vomiting, fever, pain on local pressure, constipation or loose motions. The symptoms may be slight is the attack of inflammation is mild. IF there is obstruction in the appendix by regolith or thread worms the pain may progress, there can be a fever with chill, impossible take tolerated anything orally, Ultrasonography of the abdomen and confirmation by CT scan can give a definite diagnosis when the clinical symptoms and signs are taken together into consideration. In your case there is more chance that this may be a condition called nephritis or colitis of the cecal part of large bowel. This can be pulled muscle too. Get confirmation by a clinical examination by a Surgeon and investigations. IF confirmed to be appendicitis, it is better to go for surgery, otherwise a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotics will help to get a cure."}

I was a professional water skier aka professional fool at ABC Marine World/ Africa U.S.A in Calif. I obtained a spinal cord injury. My husband retired and we moved to Washington state, Since moving to our Dream Retirement property I have been unable to find a pain Doctor. My Pain Dr.s neurosurgeons had told us this was the Meca of Pain Management . I have been forced to be almost totally bedridden or in our hot tub due to the fact that Washington State has some new laws on pain meds. Sitting in a hot tub for 4-6 hours a day is not much of a life, I am unable to walk without forearm crutches.

I went to the appointment as scheduled then all hell broke loose. I was discharged from the general practicioner because I was seen by another Doctor.

He/She can then refer you to a pain specialist since it looks like you will need close follow up and advanced treatment"}

She swings between faecal incontinence to constipation. She also had an op 6 months ago to tighten muscles to help with the incontinence. A few days before the op her back suddenly became very painful but not a pain she was used to, she felt it was more around the kidney area, but accepted it as scoliosis. She then was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneuyrism and is being monitored for that. The change in back pain has continued since.She has complained for 10 days now of constipation and has taken huge amounts of Movicol and sennacot. There has been liquid faeces passed but she feels like there is huge blockage and is complaining of extremely uncomfortable bloating, nausea etc. After reading a little about about AAA could the back pain and bloating be symptoms of that?", "output": "Hi. Thanks for your query for your Mother. Read the history of multiple problems she is suffering from and tried to correlate all. The pain in abdomen looks to be due to overdose of Senna cot and SYVICOL. They are known to cause this sort of pain. If she is still feeling of block, this can be due to impacted xenoliths which can be seen on ultrasonography and a Soap-Saline enema may solve her problem. This is probably not due to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. If it expands there be will far more severe problems than just bloating and nausea."}

Cancer is a difficult disease to treat and the progress of disease cannot be always predicted with certainty. It is possible that when he was in hospital your uncle had symptoms that were looking serious, and he has improved with time.

On reaching home, his medications might have changed, and he is responding to commands and moving his limbs. The surroundings can also have a lot of influence in the behavior of a patient. He might have been psychologically depressed when at the hospital and now after coming home he is happy to find relatives around him always and feeling comfortable. The real progress of cancer can be known by looking at brain scan and correlating that with his general health condition. He can survive for some more days at home as he is getting attention and support. Please do not worry."}

I m not sure but I think it started when i washed my vagina with soap. could you please give me some advise on what it might be and what to do. thankyou", "output": "Dear lady, What you describe is a common yeast infection of the vagina. The skin inside your vagina is usually covered by a layer of healthy bacteria, which produce an acidic mucus that protects from yeasts and other sort of infections like bad bacteria. This is why you shouldn't use soap to wash your vagina, because soap can kill the healthy bacteria, and help the yeast infection to stabilize and produce the aforementioned symptoms. If you were my patient, I would recommend using Fluconazole 1200 mg suppository inserted in your vagina. It is used only once, and it will get rid of the yeast infection. But if you want someone close to follow you, please visit a local doctor. I would also recommend you to now use soap again to wash your vagina, running water is more than enough.

Well I had four months of asthma problems and was taking steroids like 20mg a day on ond off for about 4 weeks along with much other medicine. the asthma has finally gotten better but I was wondering could the cervical ridiculopathy been caused by or worsened by the asthma because I woke up in the morning ant it felt like I was stabbed in the back and it has gone downhill fast since then including in the middle of the night I went to the hospital for the pain and they admitted me and found the problem so I was wondering was it just something that has been lingering in there or was it from the asthma", "output": "Asthma has nothing to do with cervical radiculopathy. The nerve compressed at its root while exiting from spinal cord, by various reasons, pains much and causes radiculopathy. Steroids are even used in the treatment of radiculopathy, though rarely. To overcome this, pain management by verbal support and physiotherapy should be adopted. If surgery is indicated it should be the last resort (no 100% guarantee of cure). Some herbals may support both Asthma and neurological pain, but switching should be done with determination to do long term treatment that may even be taken parallel to allopatry which doesn't counteract. Some reasonable gap is however, advised. Some easy yogic exercises, deep breathing (Panama) exercise costs nothing but immensely useful. Try it now.

Based on what you have stated, I would like to ask a few more questions for a proper answer.-Does the sensitivity leave within a few seconds from when the cold leaves the tooth?if so, then most likely the sensitivity is due to exposed root which is common.  The best way to reduce this sensitivity is to use Sensory or another antisensitive toothpaste.  You have to use this two-three times a day religiously for 3-4 weeks for it to START working.  You brush your teeth for two full minutes, spit out the excess, do not rinse out the film, do not eat or Chat Doctor.  This gives it time to work.  It takes weeks for it to gradually start working, but you will notice the difference. -Does the sensitivity persist for 15-45 seconds or longer after removal of the stimulus?if so then your dentist is right, you need root canal therapy because you have irreversible pulpits.

Get regular USG to make sure the left kidney is fine.3. It is possible for the right kidney function to reduce further as the child grows.

Let me give few facts that are proved & you can find them on Google.CMV is NOT A CAUSE FOR RECURRENT ABORTION. So there is no meaning OG doing a TORCH profile after abortion. Further few words on the antibodies. Any infection in body produces 2 types of antibodies. As soon as you get any infection(be it any infection disease you think of - Typhoid, TB, Hepatitis etc.) your body produces IGM & over time your body produces Egg, which means that some time in the past you had the infection, it is not active. So what's the meaning of taking antibiotics for some infection, which is dead & gone & has just left back few antibodies. I do agree that CMV during infection can cause irreversible anomalies in baby, needing abortion, but it is never a cause of recurrent abortion. One more thing you need to notice is - CMV - Cato Megalo Virus is a virus & there is no medicine for a virus. Antibiotics are effective against bacteria only. So taking the medication is left to you Hope I have clarified your overall the best Chat Doctor. "}

Any idea what kind of time frame we may be dealing with now?", "output": "Welcome to ChatDoctorThanks for the query. It is always hard to predict the dynamics of tumor spreading, especially metastatic, but it will cause by statistics faster spreading and less life expectancy.

Welcome to Chat Doctor. It was a good to hear that you had the important immune globulin which is where crucial to stop rabies in case of being bitten by a rabid dog. This would have neutralized the infection. As far as the vaccine is concerned, you have to have 5 injections in total. A day of delay usually doesn't cause much problem and the time that has passed is a good sign, because the risk of rabies remains for a few days. If there were no problems related to the rabies then you are in the safe zone. And let me tell you here that pain around the wound is not linked to the rabies. It shows either the wound was very deep damaging the muscles, which will take some time to heal, or the wound is infected by some other organisms also. Easily available antibiotic will be enough to take care of this problem. But for that you need to visit your clinician, who will examine the wound and refer to surgeon if the wound required some cleaning. I hope the answer was helpful.

In my opinion you are having HERD (Castro Esophageal Reflux Disease).  Gaseous distention can occur in this. Due to distention, lungs will not expand fully and patient may feel breathlessness.

Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Avoid stress and anxiety. 4.

For frequent cramps in your muscles there might be a possibility of vitamin B deficiency so I suggest taking test on vitamin B deficiency and also Keep vitamin B rich diet in your food. You can also take vitamin B tablet as a supplement. As a physiotherapist I also suggest doing back strengthening exercises as per the suggestion of your physio and do take physiotherapy treatment which can help you to relax your soft tissues as per your physiotherapist guideline. Along with frequent urination, muscle cramp if you also have pain in abdomen Then I suggest doing ultrasound for your abdomen and based on report do what is necessary by visiting your physician.

The history of Gall bladder and tubes and ovary noted. The typical pain in lower abdomen, which increases on breathing, pressure and full bladder indicate for peritonitis.

So if you had sex on the 11th, there certainly could have been viable sperm still in your system to be there to fertilize your ovulation on the 16th. Furthermore, modern pregnancy tests are extremely sensitive, and can become positive even 10 days after conception. However, if the test is not performed correctly, or if the test is left out too long beyond the time recommended reading the test on the package, a faint line can appear. So at this time, I recommend waiting for your menstrual period, and if it does not arrive on time I would repeat the pregnancy test at that point.  At this time this has should give you an easy to see, accurate answer.  But it is certainly possible that you could have conceived this cycle. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I hope this information was helpful to you. Best of luck in conceiving."}

If your smear shows that there is moderate dyskryosis then the cells in the region show suspected abnormal appearance. This does not definitively mean it is a cancer.

Not sure what to take over the counter. Any advice?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) mostly, because you are having central chest pain after dinner. But better to rule out cardiac cause first. So get done ECG. If ECG is normal then no need to worry about cardiac cause. Your central chest pain is mostly due to HERD. It is because of laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of central chest pain, burning etc. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in HERD. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and anxiety. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.4. Start Proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bad."}

It is not quite soft, rather hard. Can be painful. Infected sebaceous cyst is a kind of benign soft tissues lesion. It tends to get infected. In such situation it becomes reddish, swollen and painful. Fever can be present as well. Ganglion cyst is connected with a joint (shoulder in this case) and filled with joint fluid. Pain is characteristic for this lesion especially when moving the limb. I suggest you to consult general surgeon with these issues. Soft tissues' ultrasound should be done to diagnose it. Cyst or ganglion can be removed. If it's a lymph node, biopsy should be done. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care"}

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

I found on your website a very similar cause- and the doctor said it s NERVE COMPRESSION. my question is: how long you can have it before it s too late for surgery? can S1 affects genital area? what specialist I should see about it? (Neurologist said : find a good PM&R doctor) When the numbness goes away? how can I know the nerve is not damaged? here are my MRI results Please HELP !!! Findings: Mild disc desiccation consistent with degenerative disc disease is noted within the lumbar spine. At L1-L2 and L2-L3 no neurocompressive changes are identified. At L3-L4 there is annular disc bulging with flattening along the ventral margin of the thecal sac. No resultant central or foraminal stenosis is seen.

At L5-S1 there is central and left paracentral disc herniation with impingement and displacement on the left S1 nerve root in its lateral recess. More diffuse disc bulging also cause encroachment within the bilateral neural foramina. Degenerative endplate changes are seen at the L5-S1 level. The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal height and narrow signal characteristics. The conus medullaris is at the L1 level and displays normal morphology.

Degenerative endplate changes at this level is also noted. Annular disc bulging at L4-L5 with impression on the thecal sac. Annular disc bulging is also noted L3-L4.", "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, The intervertebral discs are cartilaginous structures present between vertebrae. The disc acts as lubricant for smooth motion of the vertebral bodies during movement of the spine. At times the disc starts bulging out from its normal position. The bulging disc starts impinging nerve roots which emanate from the spinal cord. The nerve emanate through small foramina in the vertebral bodies. These foramina are intact in your case. In your case, discs are bulging at the level of L4-L5 and L5-S1. Due to the compression, the area supplied by these nerves are affected. This is responsible for the pain and numbness in the foot region. The S1 nerve does not supply the genital region. The treatment for this condition is complete bed rest. If the condition does not improve on bed rest, surgical measures may be required. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. "}

In my opinion pregnancy occurs if semen is ejaculated in or around the vagina during the fertile period.Don't worry just rubbing of genitals without penetration does not result in pregnancy.

If the period is missed do a urine pregnancy test after a week of missed period for accurate results. Even stress regarding the though of pregnancy also might cause similar picture.

Anyhow, surgeries that are confined to foot may be carried out under local anesthesia. Local anesthesia has less complication and may be carried out if a patient has some kind of lung problem or patient is not fit for general anesthesia. As those patients who have lung infection or any type of infection, and they require general anesthesia for an elective surgery, then they are advised to wait until their infection or problem resolves. But in your case as your surgery is confined to foot, I think your doctor should consider local anesthesia, (ankle or popliteal block)I hope my answer will help you. Kind Regards."}

Facial seborrhea dermatitis classically presents with scaly patches on face particularly sides of nose, medial eyebrows or glabella, chin and upper lip etc. The patches are usually dull red and scaly. Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive dermatomes. I usually treat my patients of facial seborrhea dermatitis with a moderately potent topical steroid e.g. fluticasone propionate 0.05% cream, twice daily. This usually brings about remarkable improvement in my patients in about 10 days to 2 weeks. However, since seborrhea dermatitis is a recurrent condition and because steroids can be used forever on face therefore once significant improvement has been achieved topical steroids may be discontinued. Subsequent treatment with a topical immunomodulator like pimecrolimus is sufficient to maintain the improvement. The cream that you have been using contains pimecrolimus, and it would be more useful as a maintenance cream rather than for treating a flare up of seborrhea dermatitis. Regards"}

MRI of dorsolumbar spine to confirm diagnosis.  You need to visit radiology center nearby you and get it done.  You need to consult expert oncologist if report shows positive metastasis.

If - for example - you had a coronary artery event or cerebrovascular disease then stopping it increases THE RISK of a new cardiovascular event.

Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.  If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.  Once the viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Can it be taken continuously for few days when there is pain or should be avoided afap due to adverse side-effects?My mother is having shoulder pain and is undergoing physiotherapy since last few days.Thanks & Regards", "output": "If it is taken for time being then it is key, but should not be taken as treatment for shoulder pain. Shoulder pain has to be diagnosed properly and should be treated accordingly. I am sure the physiotherapy treatment what she is taking will be according to her diagnosis and will help her to get relief. You can also ask her to use hot and cold pack frequently to get some more soft tissue healing with relaxing soft tissue, increasing blood circulation, and reducing inflammation. Here just wanted to update you to check whether she has frozen shoulder or it's a soft issue damage (rotator cuff).because many times it is diagnosed wrong and treatment for both is different. For frozen shoulder more over as a physio I do treatment with shoulder manipulation. And for soft tissue injury the manipulation is not suggested and only the soft tissue relaxing and healing treatment only can be given. To check if your mother able to move her hand up standing against wall as well take hand on her back with little pain then it is related to soft tissue pain. And if she is not able to move hand up complete with range block feeling then it can be frozen shoulder. If still confuse then still can be diagnosed properly with MRI. Here my only advise is treat the cause of the pain and painkiller should be for time being. Hit the thanks if it is useful. Take care."}

Michelle", "output": "Hi Michelle, Following surgery to the C spine, what you can develop after a period of time is called as adjacent segment disease or degeneration. What is means is that the cervical vertebrae are subjected to increase movements and following fusion surgery this places additional stress on the intervertebral discs above and below the fusion levels, the superior levels being more affected. This can lead to narrowing of the cervical canal and cause nerve root compression if its severe enough. So kindly get Cervical spine x-rays done, get a neurological checkup done to see if you're having any sensorimotor deficits and consult a spine surgeon if these levels will require decompression and fusion as well."}

I think your daughter has allergic respiratory problem, but I would like to ask more questions about nature of cough, cold, whether she wheezes, frequency of symptoms etc. to know exact nature of her disorder. However, for allergic respiratory diseases, I would suggest her Montelukast whenever she develops symptoms. This will reduce her symptoms along with other medications prescribed by your pediatrician. If she is having problems during any specific season, I would suggest to start daily Montelukast 2 weeks before the season and continue during the season. This will also reduce the number of episodes. I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smoke and air pollution as much as possible. Limiting foods that usually trigger her episodes will also help. Childhood allergic respiratory disorders usually can improve by ages of 6-8 years, but it depends on type of allergy she has, her diet and environment, hereditary factors, genetics, etc. So It's difficult to predict most of the time. I would also suggest you to consult an Allergist who will suggest her allergy testing and help you identify what to avoid and how to. Hope this will be helpful to you.

He was ending up at the ER because his heart felt weird. The cardiologist put him on a  low dose betablocker as he is symptomatic.  The cardiologist said the PVCs are more of a nuisance then a problem.  Did do echo which was WNLs.  Holter monitor only showed PVCs.  He has been fine for approx 2 weeks now after being on the betablocker.  But, yesterday was sent to the ER for chestpain and tachycardia.  Cardiologist says needs to do a coronary angiogram.  My son is only 20 years old with no prior problems.  Is this really necessary?", "output": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, coronary angiography is must in his case. In fact, not only angiography, electrophysiologist (EP) study of heart is needed for the diagnosis of his tachycardia and PVC's (premature ventricular contractions). His symptoms are mostly due to accessory pathway in heart which is sending extra impulses and these extra impulses produce all the symptoms. So get done angiography and EP study. He may need radio frequency ablation (RFA) of accessory pathway to cure the symptoms. Don't worry, he will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}

Once you have noticed a lump in the tongue, one thing is for sure that it is not a normal part of the body. The probable causes can be:Foreign body granulomaBenign lump of the muscles Cancer This can be ascertained only by a clinical examination, FNAC or Excision biopsy. I would advise the excisional biopsy for 2 reasons1. You get rid of the lump and 2. You get a histopathological diagnosis to be certain what the disease is and carry on further treatment if needed.

The most likely explanation for the bumps in your anal area that you have noticed recently, is the development of external hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are veins in and around the anus that become dilated from the pressure of your uterus and the babies head pushing downwards, especially when you try to move your bowels.  The white bumps that you see are most likely hemorrhoids that have not become swollen with blood. The blue one that you see, more likely is closer to the surface, where the blood can be visible through the wall of the vein. As long as your anus does not itch, or that you don't have any bleeding from the area, there is nothing danger about hemorrhoids. They will generally resolve after delivery. I would ask your obstetrician to take a look at them the next time you have an appointment. In the meantime, taking site baths, which is soaking your rear end in a warm top filled with about 6 inches of water for 20 to 30 minutes, can decrease the swelling. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, and I hope you feel better,"}

If there is major damage to spinal disc with loss of curve, orthopedic doctor will suggest for surgical correction and then physiotherapy to increase strength of spinal muscle as well to reduce inflammation in soft tissue. If there is no major damage in MRI report means it can be treated with conservative management. Here you have to take some basic medication and physiotherapy treatment for pain and inflammation. Along with this spinal exercise will help to improve strength and stamina of spine. Here using hot and cold pack at home will also help for some more pain relief.

Welcome on Chat Doctor! I read carefully your question and would explain that as all your tests have shown nothing abnormal, your symptoms could be related to vaso-vagal syncope or seizures. But as EEG has resulted normal, seizures are less likely. I would like to know more about these episodes: -Do you feel them coming? Are there any specific signs, so you can predict them?- Do you remember how they occur?- Do you fall abruptly or try to hold on something to protect yourself from falling?- Do you regain conscience immediately, or you feel dizzy and foggy for some hours later, after these episodes? All these characteristics can help differentiate between a seizure and a syncope. In case of syncope, levetiracetam would be unnecessary. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, "}

As mentioned that you get pain on the lateral side of the knee, then it is advisable to get an MRI done. Since due lateral ligament and the lateral meniscus injury the pain is noticed in the lateral side of the knee. Also, at times it can be due to the other factors. But depending on the nature of the pain it becomes possible to come closer to the root cause. If the pain is radiating in nature or burning and tingling then it might be pinned nerve. Well, what you can perform to get release of these pain is first to use Hot water fermentation, and then perform slow knee strengthening exercises. You can take am advice from a physical therapist. Avoid long walks and too much weight on the right leg. Also do exercises for both legs as to balance the equality of weight transmission. Well, if the pain doesn't comes down in a week of time an MRI of the knee is suggested to ensure the precise treatment. Usually people respond well to exercises.

I appreciate your concern for the preventive measures for scabies. Scabies is a highly contagious disease caused by mites. Persons with crusted scabies are infested with very large numbers of mites; therefore risk of transmission is very high both from brief skin-to-skin contact and from contact with items such as bedding, clothing, furniture, rugs, carpeting, floors, and other famines that can become contaminated with skin scales and crusts shed by a person with crusted scabies. You must also avoid famines like towels, hand kerchief, tissue, sharing same food containers or glass of water, juice or alcohol with the persons having scabies. Hope these suggestions could be useful to you in preventing yourself from the possible transmission of the mites responsible for causing scabies. Take care of your health."}

My fasting glucose was 129 although I was not fasting and my doctor told me to go ahead and take the test anyway. So the results are more accurate as an after meal result. I did a true fasting test today and I await the result. Should I be concerned. My Dr said I m pre-diabetic.", "output": "Hello have gone through your question and understood your concern. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) measures blood glucose after you have not eaten for at least 8 hours. It is the first test done to check for prediabetes and diabetes. If you were not fasting, then the result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes. In my opinion, This result can be considerate like a random blood sugar (RBS) and measures blood glucose regardless of when you last ate. Random testing is useful because glucose levels in healthy people do not vary widely throughout the day and Blood glucose levels that vary widely may mean a problem. This test is also called a casual blood glucose test. It is true that your age, positive family history and being African American are RISC factors for Diabetes. But the test result can not be taken in consideration for the diagnosis because it is not fasting. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/DL is considered prediabetes. If its 126 mg/DL or higher or a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/DL or higher ; on two separate tests, you have diabetes.(Actually, if you were fasting, 129 mg/DL can be suggestive of diabetes not prediabetes and the next step will be to repeat the test for the confirmation of the diagnosis)In my opinion you don't have reason to be concerned because the test result is not a fasting but a random measurement, and we can not reach the diagnosis only with this test. So, be patient because the true fasting test will give the exact information about your situation. Hope this is helpful. If you have other debts, feel free and ask. Best regards."}

I hope there is no blood or green fluid in your vomits and not suffering from fever. If your bowel movements are normal. Take tab pantoprazole with metoclopramide and tab. Dicyclomine. Since you got your gall bladder removed and if symptoms persists take your doctors' opinion once. Hope I answered your question. Feel free to ask me if you have any further queries. Wish you good health. Take care. Regards"}

Welcome to Chat Doctor, Since you feel the pain only in certain movements, most likely it is caused from muscle strain. If the pain was a symptom of specific abdominal condition, you would feel it all the time not only in certain movements. If the pain doesn't seem to get better in 1 week or get worse you might need to consult a physician and get examined. Right now it doesn't seem something serious. Hope it helps. Kind Chat Doctor. "}

After reading your post, it seems that you are having bronchitis and lower respiratory tract infection.First you should get the following investigations done :-1. Chest X-ray PA view2. Complete Blood Count (CBC)3. Sputum examination (Culture and Sensitivity and AFB testing) Yellow and thick mucus can be due to some infection in the respiratory tract. Red color in the sputum can be due to some leakage of blood from thin blood vessels as a result of severe coughing. You can take bronchodilators like Levosalbutamol along with Multics like Bromine. Antibiotics, if needed can be started according to the culture/sensitivity report. Steam inhalation and chest physiotherapy will also help to cough out mucus easily. You should get yourself examined medically and investigated before starting any medication. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."}

She is 6 years old, and weighs around 49lbs. She started complianing about chest pains about 6 months ago so we took her to the hospital . The doctors there ran a series of tests on her & came back to say she has Kawasaki disease. We just took her to a pediatric Cardiologist where they are now saying all 4 chambers of her heart had been leaking and that 3 of them were healing on their own but that the valve on the right side was still leaking so they want to put her on a monitor for 30 days to I guess find out what she is doing when the pain starts in her chest. Is this a bad sign for my grandchild? Does this mean that her heart is bad or that her problems could be fetal? I am so WORRIED about our granddaughter! Please could someone explain to me about the monitor & what to expect in the future for our grandchild! Thank you so much for any help! A worried Grandmother", "output": "Hi... your granddaughter if correctly diagnosed with Kawasaki disease . Can be treated with medicines. The valve leak ... called regurgitation . Is usually mild and self resolving in most cases. The monitor (mostly a loop recorder, I guess) is for monitoring irregularities in the rate and rhythm of heart and if any changes in the heart blood flow (ischemia). Your granddaughter will surely be fine, and the disease is a treatable one."}

The two MRI reports are not matching. Encephalomalacia is often a result of old brain stroke or brain injury. Since you do not have any such history, it is difficult to establish the cause of encephalomalacia. Also, your earlier MRI was normal, this means there should have been an event between the two MRIs. You need second opinion on the two MRIs. If you can upload the MRI images, it can help us. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. "}

I try my best to improve my complexion and one day if i go out in sun i loose all the fairness i gained for months. I also apply regular sunscreen. Also let me know how to improve my fairness that lasts for ever.", "output": "Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Generally, in my patients of sun tanning I would advise then to get series of microdermabrasion followed by chemical peeling. Microdermabrasion is a procedure that removes the superficial layers of skin, and it is done with a help of machine. Then after a week or same day itself I would carry out another procedure called chemical peeling. Chemical peeling is again a similar procedure where superficial layers of skin is removed but here the effect is more profound, and it stimulates new skin generation in much better way thus giving you more youthful and radiant skin. Several options are available in chemical peels like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, TCA but my personal favorite is retinol peel or also known as Yellow peel. The rationale of combining this procedure is to get better and long-lasting effects. I am sure 6-8 sessions will bring out a pretty gratifying results. At home the results can be maintained with antioxidant tablets like Antonio HC once daily in morning (It can be safely taken for months together) and night application of cream containing mixture of glycolic acid, albumin and Comic acid. In morning, you can apply a good quality sunscreen with additional skin lightening ingredients (NIL TAN SPF). Use a good quality face wash like Fast face wash gel. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and indulge into regular exercise for healthy skin and body. Hope this was useful. Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.

In my opinion that is a kind of allergic interaction, try to apply topical anti-histamine ointments and ice padding 2 or three times a day.

Anti-histamine systemic tabs like Zyrtec may be needed to decrease your body reaction towards that bites.
